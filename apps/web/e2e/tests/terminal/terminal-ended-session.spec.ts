 * A shell terminal on an ended session can never connect: the environment
 * handler refuses it, identically, on every attempt.
 *
 * The pane's loading overlay is opaque and full-bleed, so before this was
 * handled the user saw "Connecting terminal…" forever — a spinner that was not
 * merely unhelpful but false, since nothing was connecting. Anything written
 * into the xterm underneath it was invisible.
 *
 * This asserts the outcome rather than the mechanism: the pane must say the
 * session ended, and must not be showing a connecting spinner. A unit test on
 * the reconnect loop can see neither.
