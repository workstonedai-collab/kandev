// PublicTaskMetadata returns a detached task metadata projection for API
// responses. Deferred-launch attribution and step-handoff carry are
// server-owned and must not expose their internal state to clients. The
// transient workflow-move marker carries encoded one-shot instructions and an
// internal move ID; it is server-owned lifecycle state and must never reach a
// public event or DTO.
//
// The session-ceiling replay payload is redacted for a stronger reason than
// tidiness: it carries the launch-scoped environment map, the composed prompt, its
// attachments and entity references. The record's discriminators, timestamps and
// reason code stay projected, so a client can still see that a deferral is pending,
// of which kind, since when and why.
