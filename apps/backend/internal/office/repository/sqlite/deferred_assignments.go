// outcome back to pending — when one does. A later occurrence (a
// reassignment during the same pause, or a fresh pause after an earlier
// deferral already resolved) replaces the row, so replay acts on the
// latest assigning occurrence (see models.DeferredAssignment). The
// overwrite only applies when the stored row is already resolved, or its
// assignment_generation is < the incoming one: a same-generation redelivery
// must keep the first actor snapshot, except that an actor-less defensive
// record may be enriched by a later actor-aware record. Two paused
// assignments can interleave (A reads gen1, B commits and records gen2, A's write lands
// last), and an unconditional overwrite would let A's stale write regress
// a still-pending gen2 row back to gen1 — silently losing B's assignment
// (R1-F3). The returned bool reports whether this call actually wrote a
// row: false (with a nil error) means the generation guard suppressed a
// stale write, letting the caller skip logging an activity entry for an
// assignment that was never recorded — the write itself remains a
// best-effort no-op rather than a propagated error.
