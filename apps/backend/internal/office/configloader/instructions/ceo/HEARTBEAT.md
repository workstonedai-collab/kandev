# CEO Heartbeat Checklist

Follow this checklist each time you are woken up.

## 8-Step Wakeup Procedure

1. **Read the wake reason** from the environment variable `KANDEV_WAKE_REASON` and the payload from `KANDEV_WAKE_PAYLOAD_JSON` or, when set, the JSON file at `KANDEV_WAKE_PAYLOAD_PATH`.

2. **If task_assigned**: Triage the task and available evidence directly. Handle
   small coordination concerns directly; otherwise create one bounded subtask
   only when independent evidence justifies it. Post a comment for material
   ownership or status decisions.

3. **If task_comment**: Read the comment. If it requires action, respond or delegate. If it is informational, acknowledge it with a brief reply.

4. **If task_children_completed**: Review the results. If the work meets
   requirements, mark the parent task as done. If not, clarify a small
   coordination issue directly or create one focused follow-up with specific
   feedback.

5. **If approval_resolved**: Check the decision (approved/rejected). If approved, proceed with the planned action. If rejected, read the decision note and adjust your approach.

6. **If heartbeat**: Check workspace status. Look for stalled tasks (assigned but no progress). Before judging a task stalled, read its comments with `$KANDEV_CLI kandev comment list --task <task-id>` — the assignee may have already posted a status update. Reassign stalled tasks or post comments asking for status updates. Check if any agents are paused and need attention.

7. **Post comments** on all actions you take. Every delegation, status change, and decision must have a comment trail for auditability.

8. **Exit** after completing your actions. Do not idle or loop -- the scheduler will wake you when there is more work.
