# Server-state migrations

[Roadmap](README.md) · Inventory at main `359b5ffdbb6`, 2026-09-27.

The target is one owner for each server resource, not a complete replacement of Zustand.
TanStack Query owns finite snapshots after migration. Zustand retains UI state and unmigrated resources.
WebSocket remains the transport for live events and streams.

## Platform / System inventory

| ID       | Resource               | Current owner and evidence                                                                                                              | Status                                                   | Completion boundary                                                                             |
| -------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| QUERY-01 | About SystemInfo       | Query through [use-system-info.ts](../../apps/web/hooks/domains/system/use-system-info.ts)                                              | Done, [#3977](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/pull/3977) | Snapshot and request lifecycle removed from Zustand. Separate process-control probes remain     |
| QUERY-02 | Database statistics    | Zustand `system.database` and local request state in [use-database-stats.ts](../../apps/web/hooks/domains/system/use-database-stats.ts) | Proposed, first candidate                                | All consumers use one Query entry. Remove migrated state/actions and duplicate fetch effects    |
| QUERY-03 | Backup list            | Zustand `system.backups` and [use-backups.ts](../../apps/web/hooks/domains/system/use-backups.ts)                                       | Proposed, after QUERY-02                                 | List and relevant mutations share targeted invalidation. Preserve reload return/error behavior  |
| QUERY-04 | Disk usage             | Zustand snapshot, job observation, and polling in [use-disk-usage.ts](../../apps/web/hooks/domains/system/use-disk-usage.ts)            | Proposed, after QUERY-02                                 | Query owns the snapshot. Refresh, terminal job events, and missed-event recovery remain correct |
| QUERY-05 | Other System resources | Outside this bounded inventory                                                                                                          | Deferred                                                 | Inventory jobs, retention, and maintenance independently before selecting another resource      |

### QUERY-02: database statistics

This resource proves mutable data behavior. SystemInfo's infinite freshness is not a reusable default.
The design must define stale time, refresh behavior, failure presentation, cancellation, and identity scope.
Backend URL, process generation, and auth boundaries need explicit treatment. Workspace scope needs evidence, not an assumed key field.

Completion evidence includes concurrent consumers, explicit reload, failure recovery, and identity transitions.
Tests must preserve unrelated form state. The implementation must remove the old state owner in the same PR.

### QUERY-03: backups

The current `reload()` returns `Promise<SnapshotInfo[]>` and rethrows errors.
Callers can depend on both behaviors.
The design must inventory create, delete, restore, and any other operation that changes the list.
Each applicable mutation needs explicit invalidation or cache-update behavior.
Completion includes empty-list, error, mutation, permission, and backend/auth transition coverage.

### QUERY-04: disk usage

The current hook observes terminal `disk-walk` jobs and reloads the snapshot.
It also polls every 1500 milliseconds while the snapshot reports `computing`.
This fallback covers a completion event missed before the WebSocket connection opens.

The design must identify one owner for event-to-cache invalidation.
Completion includes success, failure, duplicate events, missed events, reconnect, and leaving the page during a request.
Removing the fallback requires equivalent recovery evidence. Moving job streams into Query is outside this increment.

## Other systems

| System                    | Disposition                    | Prerequisite before migration                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tasks / Office            | Deferred, not inventoried here | Agree projections and event ordering before changing cache ownership     |
| Sessions / transcripts    | Deferred, not inventoried here | Separate finite metadata from high-frequency streams and ordered history |
| Integrations / code hosts | Deferred, not inventoried here | Inventory provider capabilities, credentials, and repository identity    |
| Workspaces / repositories | Deferred, not inventoried here | Inventory boot snapshots, selected UI state, and resource identity       |

These rows are not claims that every resource belongs in Query.
Each selected resource gets its own row and owning system-design reference.

## Pilot constraints to preserve

The [SystemInfo design](../specs/platform/system-design/system-info-query-cache.md) owns the current technical contract.
The [restart design](../specs/platform/system-design/backend-restart-page-recovery.md) owns process-generation recovery.

- The authenticated app branch has a stable QueryClient. Identity changes must not remount forms or the shell.
- Query keys distinguish the full API base URL, page boot ID, and auth identity for SystemInfo.
- Native query cancellation reaches the fetch transport.
- Obsolete SystemInfo entries are removed in the same effect as cancellation, without a delayed removal callback.
- A rapid A-to-B-to-A identity transition must not remove the current A query.
- The boot payload contains no full SystemInfo snapshot. The pilot does not invent `initialData`.
- Restart, self-update, and generation probes remain independent no-store reads.
- SystemInfo uses `networkMode: "always"`. Its process-immutable freshness policy does not define mutable-resource policy.

The current cleanup targets SystemInfo only. The second resource needs deliberate identity cleanup coverage without erasing unrelated caches.

## Entry checklist

Before an entry becomes planned, record:

1. The owning system, source paths, consumers, and current state owner.
2. The approved identity, freshness, mutation, boot, and WebSocket contracts.
3. The state, effects, subscriptions, or actions that the PR will remove.
4. The applicable existing requirements and system design, or an explicit design gap.
5. The assignee, work order, task link, and focused verification commands.

Before an entry becomes done, record its merged PR and regression evidence.
Do not retain dual authoritative caches or hidden bridge setters as the completed migration.
