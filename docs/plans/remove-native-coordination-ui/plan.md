# Implementation plan: Remove native coordination controls

## Overview

Remove the Manager and Completion requirements controls introduced by
[PR #3994](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/pull/3994). Restore the desktop and
phone task layout while preserving the plugin contracts and task data.

The user requested a removal plan and an audit of other UI changes. This package
covers the task-detail removal. The [PR audit](pr-3994-ui-audit.md) identifies
other changes and recommends their disposition; it does not authorize their removal.
The user later requested implementation of this package.

The task system owns this package because it owns the task-detail outcome and
its management and completion contracts. The existing task requirement and design
are amended in place. No separate UI specification or new ADR is necessary:
the amendment records the local presentation boundary and its tradeoffs.

## Scope

### In scope

- Remove both native rows on desktop, the shared phone toolbar, and their private inspection/editing surfaces.
- Restore phone header spacing, shared-error layout, composer clearance, and navigation.
- Remove dead component helpers and unused translations only after a reference check.
- Preserve domain enforcement, APIs, SDK exports, database records, history, and normal workflow error feedback.
- Replace tests of removed UI with desktop/phone regressions and retain recovery coverage at the API boundary.
- Correct public claims about native task controls during implementation.

### Out of scope

- Reverting all of #3994, removing its backend functionality, or changing database schemas.
- Removing automation UI, plugin capability settings, retained transcripts, or reusable Host UI exports. These are audited separately.
- Adding a replacement native menu, settings page, hidden feature flag, or conditional empty-state variant.
- Building or publishing a coordinator plugin UI. No existing plugin recovery UI is assumed.
- Changing human consent, authorization, approval receipts, or completion policy.

## Technical approach

### Task layout and component removal

Remove `TaskCoordinationControls` and its invocation from
`apps/web/components/task/task-page-inner.tsx`. Remove the three
`task-management-claim-*` files, five `task-completion-gate-*` files, and
`use-task-completion-gate-actions.ts` after confirming their private import tree.
Keep `lib/api/domains/task-management-claims-api.ts`,
`task-completion-gates-api.ts`, their exports and tests, and the workflow move
API. Keep completion flags in workflow snapshots and status DTOs.

Restore the top-offset behavior across `task-layout.tsx` and
`mobile/session-mobile-layout.tsx`. The parent of commit `f24a785cd30` supplies
the reference: `3.5rem` without a shared task error, zero when the error surface
already provides the offset. Preserve later changes, including #3986; do not
restore entire files. Retain safe-area padding and bottom navigation clearance.

Delete unused `managementClaim*` and `completionGate*` locale keys only when no
remaining source references them. Search all catalogs and `_verbatim.json` files.
Do not remove `plugins:managedChat*` strings used by public Host UI components.
Do not shrink the i18n guard allowlist.

### Data and human recovery

The removal does not alter stored claims or completion criteria. A task with
unmet criteria remains blocked, and the existing workflow error surface reports
failed moves. Human claim release/transfer, evidence updates, and one-move override
remain authorized API operations. Plugins gain no new human authority.

This deliberately removes built-in browser shortcuts for human recovery. The
current Host UI exports do not expose these task dialogs. Moving them into a
plugin is separate work and must respect the existing public API and consent
boundary. Document this limitation instead of implying that a replacement exists.

### Test migration

Replace the four browser specs that depend on the removed Manager/Inspect
buttons. Retain claim conflict and unavailable-owner recovery in handler tests.
Retain stale evidence, weakening confirmation, and reasoned one-move override
in service tests. Add HTTP regressions if transport-level recovery assertions
would otherwise disappear. Do not replace meaningful domain coverage with
absence assertions or skip the old suites merely to make the run pass.

### Documentation

Update `docs/public/plugins-authoring.md` at the claim and completion sections
that currently promise native task-detail controls. Preserve its SDK examples.
Keep historical #3994 results as dated evidence; mark its UI-03 preview and
work orders 09/10 as superseded for presentation only. Domain results remain valid.

## ASCII UI preview

### UI-01: Desktop task detail, ordinary or managed task

```text
Before (#3994)
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Existing task title and workflow controls          |
| Manager: None                            [Manage] |
| Completion requirements: 0 of 0          [Inspect]|
| Session / chat                    | Files / changes|
+---------------------------------------------------+
After
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Existing task title and workflow controls          |
| Existing error feedback, only when applicable      |
| Session / chat                    | Files / changes|
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

### UI-02: Phone task detail, ordinary or managed task

```text
Before (#3994)             After
+----------------------+  +----------------------+
| Fixed task header    |  | Fixed task header    |
| Manager | Completion |  | Existing error, if any|
| Active panel         |  | Active panel         |
| Composer             |  | Composer             |
| Bottom navigation    |  | Bottom navigation    |
+----------------------+  +----------------------+
```

There is no replacement toolbar, blank strip, manager-loading row, or gate-loading
row. Existing errors remain conditional, including shared launch errors and
failed completion moves. The phone keeps one active panel and internal scroll
owner, dynamic viewport sizing, safe-area clearance, and existing touch controls.
These structural choices satisfy AC-004.1, AC-004.2, and AC-004.4. Spacing in the
sketch is illustrative. The current task layout is the mobile exemplar.

## Tests

| Criteria | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| AC-TASKS-COMPLETION-004.1 | New `task-coordination-ui-removal.spec.ts`: ordinary and configured tasks have no native controls or claim/gate detail fetches on open/reload |
| AC-TASKS-COMPLETION-004.2 | New `mobile-task-coordination-ui-removal.spec.ts`; `session-mobile-layout.test.tsx` offset cases; existing mobile launch-error and clarification flows |
| AC-TASKS-COMPLETION-004.3 | `TestTaskManagementClaimFencing`, `TestHTTPReleaseTaskManagementClaim`, `TestHTTPTransferTaskManagementClaimBindsCurrentHumanActor`, `TestCompletionGateEntryPoints`; API client and Host API tests |
| AC-TASKS-COMPLETION-004.4 | Desktop E2E rejects a blocked completion through the normal workflow stepper and shows the existing error banner; handler/service tests retain authorization and gate coverage |

## E2E tests

Use `apps/web/e2e/tests/task/task-coordination-ui-removal.spec.ts` with `chromium`
and `mobile-task-coordination-ui-removal.spec.ts` with `mobile-chrome`.
Cover ordinary and configured tasks, no detail requests, a blocked move through
the task stepper, and normal phone chat. Assert active UI readiness before
negative DOM/request assertions. Use causal waits instead of arbitrary sleeps.

Phone checks cover the fixed-header gap, composer clearance, bottom navigation,
and document width. The existing phone launch-failure and clarification suites
protect shared-error and message paths. Managed E2E commands in work order 01
rebuild the application before browser tests.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Remove native controls and preserve layout/contracts](task-01-remove-task-controls.md)
- [x] [Task 02: Update public guidance and delivery records](task-02-update-guidance.md)

Run tasks 01 and 02 in sequence. Both work orders record their results.

## Verification results

Planning validation on September 28, 2026:

- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: passed, 321 decisions and 1,220 specifications.
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py`: passed, 36 tests.
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- `git diff --check -- docs/specs docs/plans`: passed.
- Local `.github/scripts/pr-docs.cjs` coverage preflight: the current documentation-only diff is exempt. A simulated planned source change validates both new work orders and their linked plan, design, requirement, and acceptance IDs.
- `git status --short`: only the design package and related specification/delivery annotations changed; all files remain unstaged.

The Python checks used `TMPDIR=/root/.cache/kandev-coordination-plan-tmp`
because `/tmp` was full. No shared files were deleted.
Implementation validation on September 28, 2026:

- Focused frontend Vitest: 108 tests passed across 6 files. Focused Go tests passed in `internal/task/handlers` and `internal/task/service`.
- Web typecheck and i18n checks passed. Desktop E2E passed 1 test, including a blocked move and error banner. Mobile E2E passed 14 tests across layout, launch recovery, and clarification.
- The desktop and phone screenshots were inspected. Phone checks confirmed the composer stays above bottom navigation and the page has no horizontal overflow.
- Public documentation tests passed, 62/62. The public docs validator accepted all 47 pages.
- The specification catalog accepted 321 decisions and 1,220 specifications. All specification files passed lint.
- The local PR documentation-coverage preflight accepted both changed work orders for the simulated source diff.
- `git diff --check` passed. Working tree changes remain unstaged.

Review follow-up on September 28, 2026 fixed phone feedback that could begin
under the fixed task header after the toolbar was removed. Page-level move,
ensure-session, and recovery feedback now reserve the header and safe-area space
at their shared parent. Ordinary chat and shared-task-error layouts retain one
clearance owner.

The subsequent PR review found that the panel still added its safe-area inset
after the parent reserved it, and that the recovery card could use a newer live
task status than the page-level offset predicate. The panel now has zero top
padding when page-level feedback owns clearance. The page resolves the bootstrap
recovery error from the latest task-status summary once and uses that value for
both the recovery card and the clearance predicate.

- The final focused frontend Vitest run passed 81 tests across four files,
  covering the feedback branches, live bootstrap status, safe-area ownership,
  ordinary pages, shared errors, and desktop behavior.
- The managed mobile E2E passed six targeted tests across coordination removal
  and launch recovery. It measured
  ensure-session and status-unavailable feedback against the fixed header,
  confirmed both retry controls are tappable, and checked shared-error spacing.
- The desktop coordination-removal E2E passed 1 test on the reviewed changes.
  Web typecheck and scoped ESLint passed.
- `pnpm run i18n:check`, documentation catalog validation, all specification
  lint, and `git diff --check` passed.

## Risks

- Removing the toolbar without restoring phone offsets puts content under the fixed header.
- Browser takeover/override shortcuts disappear. APIs remain; no replacement plugin UI is included.
- A broad revert removes confirmation security or plugin capabilities and can overwrite later changes.
- Removing old E2E files without migrating their domain assertions loses recovery coverage.
- `/tmp` was full during planning. The repository had free space. Before implementation checks, use an approved writable temporary directory or resolve capacity; do not delete shared files blindly.
