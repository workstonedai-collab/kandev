# Task 01: Replace requirement code search

## Summary

Locate requirement definitions with bounded `git grep` against the exact PR
head instead of GitHub code search. Preserve existing structural validation,
per-member merge-queue isolation, and trusted workflow execution.

## In scope

- Build a Git-object reader that fetches the base repository's PR ref,
  verifies the requested head SHA, and searches only referenced requirement
  directories without checking out the PR head. Fetch public refs anonymously.
- Pass candidate paths through existing exact-head document reads and
  validation; remove code search, base-identity optimization, and filename
  fallback from the loader.
- Add deterministic tests with temporary Git trees and update CI workflow
  contract and `.github/AGENTS.md` guidance where the new boundary requires it.

## Out of scope

- Coverage exemptions, label permissions, status context, ruleset changes, and
  unrelated API retry behavior.
- Private-repository support, new credentials, execution of PR files, or
  automatic reruns of #3834.

## Acceptance

- An unchanged requirement document containing multiple referenced IDs, and
  valid new or moved documents, pass from the exact PR head without GitHub
  code-search calls; missing or duplicate definitions still fail coverage.
- A stale, unavailable, incomplete, unsafe, or over-limit Git lookup returns an
  infrastructure error and cannot publish a success for the wrong revision.
- Fork and merge-group fixtures use each verified member head while the
  workflow continues to execute only trusted checked-out code.

## Verification

Run from the repository root:

```bash
node --test .github/scripts/pr-docs-git.test.cjs .github/scripts/pr-docs.test.cjs
python3 .github/scripts/pr-docs-workflow-contract_test.py
python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning_test.py
python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning.py
zizmor .github/workflows
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check
```

- `docs/plans/pr-documentation-git-lookup/plan.md`

## Dependencies

None. Implement as one end-to-end change; the previous documentation coverage
plan remains complete.

## Risks

The fetch ref may advance during evaluation, a partial clone may lack needed
blobs, and malformed paths can appear in Git output. Match the API head SHA,
bound all child processes, and treat incomplete data as infrastructure error.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirements](../../specs/ci/requirements/pull-request-documentation-coverage.md)
- [System design](../../specs/ci/system-design/pull-request-documentation-coverage.md)
- [Plan](plan.md) and [decision](../../decisions/2026-09-27-pr-documentation-git-lookup.md)
- `.github/AGENTS.md`, the current validator and tests, and the PR walkthrough's
  verified Git-object fetch pattern.

## Results

Implemented exact-head Git requirement lookup with bounded object fetch and
search, SHA verification, path and output validation, and snapshot-scoped
caching. The validator uses existing exact-head API reads for candidate files,
and removes GitHub code search and filename fallback. Tests cover the PR #3834
shape, new, moved, deleted, and duplicate definitions, mismatch and failure
paths, merge-group isolation, and trusted-checkout preservation.

PR fixup also preserves the Git operation stage when the child process cannot
start and isolates fixture Git commands from inherited `GIT_*` overrides. The
workflow contract keeps credentials disabled because this public repository's
pull-request refs are fetched anonymously; private-repository support remains
out of scope.

Passed the Node validator and Git reader tests (111 tests), workflow contract
(7 tests), action-pinning tests (9 tests) and lint (24 workflow files),
documentation catalog validation (317 decisions and 1210 specifications),
specification lint, harness checks, Node syntax checks, `git diff --check`, and
the focused `pr-docs.yml` security audit. The repository-wide audit
(`zizmor .github/workflows`) remains nonzero because of findings in other
workflow files; the changed `pr-docs.yml` workflow has no findings.
