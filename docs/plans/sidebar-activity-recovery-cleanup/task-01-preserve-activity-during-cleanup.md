# Task 01: Preserve Activity During Completed Move Cleanup

## Summary

Prove that startup recovery changes an idle task's activity time, then keep its timestamp stable when clearing completed manual-move markers. Preserve marker convergence and the conditional guard against a newer move.

## In scope

- Add a failing startup integration regression that observes `tasks.updated_at` and projected `last_activity_at` before and after completed-marker cleanup.
- Extend the repository contract for SQLite and PostgreSQL to cover successful, absent, and stale-generation clears plus reconstructed activity.
- Add a deterministic guarded-workflow-change race test proving a stale source snapshot cannot restore lifecycle markers cleared by startup recovery.
- Preserve `updated_at` in completed-marker cleanup and clear stale lifecycle markers from cross-step move snapshots; verify a genuine subsequent task mutation still advances activity.

## Out of scope

- Historical data repair, general metadata timestamp policy, and frontend changes.

## Acceptance

1. A completed-marker sweep clears only the intended markers and leaves task `updated_at` and summary `last_activity_at` unchanged; rebuilding the summary does not reintroduce the cleanup time.
2. Failed feeder reconciliation retains the marker; a stale clear cannot erase a newer pending or completed move; a workflow-change source snapshot cannot restore a stale pending marker after recovery cleanup; the existing `task.updated` notification still occurs after a successful clear.
3. A real task edit or workflow move after cleanup advances activity and changes the sidebar order through the existing contract.

## Verification

Run from the repository root:

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/task/repository/sqlite -run 'Test(SetTaskMetadataKeyIfPresentSQLite|PostgresSetTaskMetadataKeyIfPresent|TaskLastActivityBatch|PostgresTaskLastActivityBatch|ClearManualMoveLifecycleMarkersPreservesActivity)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/orchestrator -run 'Test(RecoverTaskLifecycleToken|RecoveryDoesNotClearPendingMarkerFromNewManualMove|RecoveryRetriesWhenNewManualMoveAlreadyCompleted|FailedManualMoveContinuationRetainsCompletionMarker)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/task/statussummary -run 'LastActivity' -count=1)
(cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run tests/task/sidebar-filter.spec.ts -- --grep 'sorts by last activity')
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome tests/task/mobile-sidebar-views.spec.ts -- --grep 'mobile last activity sort')
```

The PostgreSQL repository case runs when `KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` is configured. Record it as skipped when that database is unavailable; do not treat a SQLite pass as PostgreSQL evidence.

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/task/repository/sqlite/task.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/task/repository/sqlite/task_metadata_cas_test.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/lifecycle_sweep_startup_test.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/task/service/service_workflow.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/task/service/change_workflow_test.go`

## Dependencies

None.

## Risks

- The `updated_at` predicate is a move-generation guard even after the successful clear stops writing a new timestamp. Concurrent newer-move regressions must remain green.
- The startup integration test must use the persisted task timestamp and real summary projection, rather than mocking the timestamp it needs to protect.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Sidebar last activity sort requirements](../../specs/ui/requirements/sidebar-last-activity-sort.md)
- [Sidebar last activity sort system design](../../specs/ui/system-design/sidebar-last-activity-sort.md)
- [Activity timestamp decision](../../decisions/2026-08-17-separate-task-activity-from-summary-freshness.md)

## Results

Implemented the timestamp-preserving cleanup in both SQL dialect branches.
The repository contract verifies marker removal, unchanged `updated_at`, stable
activity reconstruction, a genuine subsequent task edit, and stale-generation
refusal. The service regression verifies that a guarded workflow change cannot
restore a stale pending marker when recovery cleanup lands between source read
and write. The orchestrator regression verifies marker convergence, unchanged
task state and live activity through the status projector when startup
recovery publishes `task.updated`; it also checks that task-updated publication
errors during recovery are observed by the test.

Validation passed:

- Repository, orchestrator, and status-summary targeted Go tests.
- Service and orchestrator packages under `-race`, including the workflow-change/cleanup race.
- `make build` from `apps/backend`.
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` from `apps`.
- Desktop `sorts by last activity` E2E and mobile `mobile last activity sort` E2E.

The PostgreSQL marker-cleanup contract was skipped because
`KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` was unset in this environment.
