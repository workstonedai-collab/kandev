# Control sizing sweep inventory

## Status and method

Snapshot: 2026-09-10. Production implementation is complete.

A read-only TypeScript AST scan examined 1526 TSX source files under
`apps/web/components`, `apps/web/app`, and `apps/packages/ui/src`.
It found 681 candidate attributes across 315 files.
The scan inspected button-like tags, Inputs, SelectTriggers, Comboboxes,
CommandInputs, and dialog actions for explicit height classes and large sizes.

These are candidates, not 681 confirmed bugs.
Responsive branches, content-sized rows, and correct touch-only controls also match.
The scan does not resolve named class constants or inherited geometry.
It does not establish which components mount in each viewport.

Every listed candidate has an inspected control and one final disposition. A checked box records source review and, where the control is covered by a representative flow, rendered evidence. Follow-up helper, CSS, size-prop, and padding-only findings are listed in the additional implementation section.

## Confirmed starting points

| Source | Evidence | Intended correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task/chat/session-stopped-banner.tsx` | Three actions use unconditional min-h-11 | Standard desktop height plus scoped touch minimum |
| `task/chat/dynamic-route-recovery.tsx` | Retry/skip/cancel/stop share unconditional min-h-11 | Standard desktop actions |
| `settings/layouts/layout-profile-list.tsx` | Action wrapper uses sm:min-h-8 | Standard desktop actions |
| `settings/layouts/layout-settings.tsx` | Input uses sm:min-h-9 and actions use sm:min-h-8 | Aligned standard fields/actions |
| `settings/workspaces/workspace-settings-shell.tsx` | Heading picker overrides h-9 | Standard trigger height |
| `settings/workflow-section-actions.tsx` | Ordinary toolbar actions use size=sm | Standard ordinary actions |
| `settings/repository-secret-bindings.tsx` | Inputs/selects/actions use unconditional 44px classes | Aligned desktop group and touch targets |
| `settings/system/storage/storage-action-button.tsx` | Button and disabled wrapper impose min-h-11 | Shared standard dimensions |
| `settings/system/storage/storage-policy-fields.tsx` | settingsControlClassName receives h-11 | Remove caller override |
| `settings/system/storage/storage-adoption-field.tsx` | Input uses h-11 | Standard field |
| `settings/settings-control.ts` | Only a desktop minimum constrains callers | Shared complete sizing contract |
| `task/workflow-step-disclosure.tsx` | Move here already uses h-7 and coarse h-11 | Preserve action sizing and inspect row spacing |

Paths in this table are relative to `apps/web/components`.
The table includes helper files outside the AST candidate list.

## Complementary search

```bash
rg -n '(min-h-|max-h-|h-|size-)(8|9|10|11|12|\[)|size="(sm|lg)"|height\s*:' \
  apps/web/components apps/web/app apps/packages/ui/src \
  -g '*.tsx' -g '*.ts' -g '*.css' -g '!*.test.*'
rg -n 'settingsControlClassName|settingsActionClassName|touchButtonClass|buttonVariants|triggerClassName' \
  apps/web/components apps/web/app apps/packages/ui/src
```

Inspect padding-only raw buttons, wrappers, flex stretching, and data-size selectors separately.
Repeat these searches after each migration family.
Do not mechanically replace every result.

## Disposition key

- **changed in implementation:** the candidate was migrated to the shared standard or compact contract.
- **already conforming:** the candidate already receives the correct role from a shared primitive.
- **touch-only:** the candidate is intentionally a touch composition.
- **content-sized:** the candidate is a content surface such as a row, card, menu, chip, or picker option.
- **documented exception:** the candidate is specialized chrome covered by the system design exceptions.

## Shared primitives

- [x] `apps/packages/ui/src/sidebar.tsx` — documented exception; specialized chrome retains independent geometry.

## Completion evidence

Implementation completed on 2026-09-10.

- Shared primitives now own the 28px standard, 24px compact, and responsive coarse-pointer touch classes.
- Ordinary task, settings, integration, Office, navigation, and shared-wrapper controls were migrated; retained rows identify content-sized, touch-only, or documented specialized geometry.
- Red/green regressions covered shared controls, completed-session actions, task creation, Layouts, repository secrets, workflow navigation, settings typography, and representative application controls.
- Final focused Vitest and managed E2E results are recorded in the work orders and plan.
- The initial source sweep was closed on 2026-09-10. A follow-up audit on 2026-09-27 found missed ordinary actions; see [control-sizing follow-up](../control-sizing-follow-up/plan.md).

## Post-completion follow-up outcomes (2026-09-27)

The re-audit found the following missed size overrides. The follow-up corrected the ordinary desktop controls and retained touch-sized actions only in touch contexts.

- [x] `apps/web/components/confirmation/action-confirm-popover.tsx` — both actions use the standard 28px desktop size and adaptive touch size.
- [x] `apps/web/components/automations/automation-delete-confirm-dialog.tsx` — confirmation actions use the standard adaptive size.
- [x] `apps/web/components/task/file-upload-conflict-dialog.tsx` — choice actions use compact 24px desktop sizing with touch minima; footer actions use the standard adaptive size.
- [x] `apps/web/components/task/remote-contribution-resolution-dialog.tsx` — confirmation actions use the standard adaptive size.
- [x] `apps/web/components/settings/plugin-executor-profile-dialog.tsx` — the name input and actions use the standard adaptive size.
- [x] `apps/web/components/settings/plugin-executor-profile-page.tsx` — the edit name field and Back/Delete actions use the standard adaptive size.
- [x] `apps/web/components/settings/canvas-rename-dialog.tsx` — the name input and actions use the standard adaptive size.
- [x] `apps/web/components/task/add-workspace-sources/add-workspace-sources-dialog.tsx` — footer actions use the standard adaptive size and the row removal icon uses the responsive icon size.
- [x] `apps/web/components/task-edit-dialog-dependencies.tsx` — retry actions use the standard adaptive size; the compact info icon retains its touch target for coarse pointers.
- [x] `apps/web/app/office/workspace/settings/export/export-preview.tsx` — the compact retry action is 24px on desktop and touch-sized on phones/coarse pointers; the 44px Back action is confined to its touch drawer branch.
- [x] `apps/web/components/runs/automation-detail-page.tsx` — the compact stop action is 24px on desktop and touch-sized on phones/coarse pointers.
- [x] `apps/web/components/integrations/integration-change-request-status-content.tsx` — reviewed and retained; the 44px Open review action exists only in the mobile Drawer branch.

Search results that are drawer-only, coarse-pointer-only, menu rows, navigation rows, or content-sized selections remain outside this follow-up and keep their existing dispositions.
