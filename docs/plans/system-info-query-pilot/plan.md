# Delivery Plan: SystemInfo Query Cache Pilot

## Outcome

Move the System > About `SystemInfo` snapshot and request state to one identity-scoped TanStack Query cache. Preserve the existing About presentation, authenticated endpoint, page boot ID, backend restart guard, and every other System state owner. Keep one QueryClient stable for the authenticated app branch and remove obsolete identity entries without remounting shell state. This refactor adds no product behavior or boot-payload fields.

## Contracts

- The [SystemInfo query design](../../specs/platform/system-design/system-info-query-cache.md) defines cache ownership and identity. The [backend restart design](../../specs/platform/system-design/backend-restart-page-recovery.md) remains authoritative for process-generation detection.
- The existing restart requirement's ACs `.1` and `.2` remain regression invariants: the page uses its existing boot ID and the reconnect guard keeps its separate no-store probe.
- The frontend query is lazy, keyed by canonical full API base URL, page boot ID, auth mode, authenticated state, and user ID. Workspace does not scope this process-wide resource.
- Build and process identity fields are immutable for one backend process. Explicit refetch remains available. Other System resources and the restart, restart-flow, and self-update probes retain their existing owners.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Move SystemInfo to the scoped Query cache](task-01-system-info-cache.md) — done

## Verification results

- The focused SystemInfo, app error-boundary, state-provider, System slice, restart guard, restart flow, self-update, and System API suite passes: 81 tests across 8 files. The provider tests preserve an edited non-query child's state across identity changes and prevent delayed cleanup from removing a returned identity's cache entry.
- Web typecheck and lint pass. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` passes from `apps/`.
- Architecture lint, documentation validation, specification lint, the i18n ratchet, and `git diff --check` pass.
- The managed mobile Docker permissions E2E passes both member and admin cases.
