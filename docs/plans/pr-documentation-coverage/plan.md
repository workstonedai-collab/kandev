# Implementation plan: PR documentation coverage

## Overview

Build a deterministic coverage validator, integrate PR status reporting, add merge-queue evaluation and contributor guidance, then refine narrow path exemptions from observed repository-maintenance cases.
The CI system owns this package because it controls repository checks and label exceptions.

## Scope

In scope: narrow exemptions including the canonical plugin registry source, linked artifact validation, the exact `no-docs-allow` override, current-revision statuses, queue compatibility, and actionable summaries.

Out of scope: AI classification, application UI, automatic label management, publishing a PR, and live ruleset mutations.
Public user documentation remains governed by the existing contribution checklist.

## Technical approach

Use the proposed `.github/scripts/pr-docs.cjs` module for pure policy functions and bounded GitHub reads.
Use `.github/workflows/pr-docs.yml` for base-controlled execution and the `PR documentation coverage` commit status.
Reuse the existing Node runtime from GitHub-hosted runners and the built-in test runner; no pnpm dependency installation is needed.
Register Node and workflow contract tests in `.github/workflows/lint-action-pinning.yml`.
Keep `plugin-registry/plugins.yaml` as an exact path exemption in the classifier; do not broaden the rule to the full registry tree.

Existing patterns: `.github/workflows/pr-size-label.yml` for metadata pagination,
`.github/scripts/pr-size-label-workflow-contract_test.py` for workflow checks, and
`docs/ci-merge-queue.md` for required-check rollout constraints.

## Tests

All named test suites below are proposed files.

| Criteria | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.2 through .6 | `pr-docs.test.cjs`: classification and artifact graph fixtures |
| AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.7 | `pr-docs.test.cjs`: exact registry-source exemption and mixed-path trigger fixture |
| AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.1; AC-CI-PR-DOCS-002.1 through .4 | Fake GitHub adapter exercises draft/fork events and label transitions |
| AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.1 through .3 | API failures, pagination caps, stale head/label reads, path and content restrictions |
| AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.4 through .5 | Per-member queue evaluation, active prefix reevaluation, mismatched queue boundaries, override removal, and rollout checklist |

Use a representative #3137 fixture: `fix(worktree)` with runtime recovery paths and no artifacts fails.
Do not fetch the live PR in unit tests.

## End-to-end evidence

No application browser flow changes. The workflow contract and mocked API tests run locally.
After deployment, record real GitHub run URLs for an uncovered PR, a covered PR, an exempt PR, a fork, override addition/removal without pushes, and a merge group.
Verify one member's documents or override cannot satisfy another member.
Live smoke tests and required-check activation are deployment steps, not completed local evidence.

Execute sequentially. No subagents are authorized.

## Verification results

Task 01's 2026-09-13 regression fix reuses requirement searches and directory
listings within each exact-head snapshot. Its deterministic quota regression
now uses three searches for six work orders. All 50 Node tests, five workflow
contract tests, documentation catalog/specification checks, and whitespace
checks pass. A GET-only evaluation of exact PR #3626 head `93abff34efe8c9ab2bec68acb8e6aba1eb2a23d4`
returned covered with three searches and no failed requests. See Task 01 for
red/green evidence and limits. Consumption by trusted `main` and the new PR's
CI/review gates remain delivery work; no status override or merge is claimed.

Design validation on 2026-09-10:

- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py`: 36 tests passed.
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- `git diff --check -- docs/specs docs/decisions docs/plans/pr-documentation-coverage`: passed.
- `git status --short -- docs/plans/pr-documentation-coverage`: confirmed the new package is present and untracked.

Implementation is complete. Live GitHub smoke-test evidence and required-check
activation remain deployment steps and are not claimed by this change.

Implementation verification on 2026-09-10:

- `node --test .github/scripts/pr-docs.test.cjs`: 35 tests passed.
- `python3 .github/scripts/pr-docs-workflow-contract_test.py`: 5 tests passed.
- `python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning_test.py`: 9 tests passed.
- `python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning.py`: 24 workflows passed.
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- `zizmor .github/workflows/pr-docs.yml`: no findings.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

Repository-wide `zizmor .github/workflows` still reports existing findings in
unrelated workflows; the new workflow has no reported findings.

## Amendment: canonical plugin registry source

The original three work orders remain complete. This amendment adds one exact
path exemption for the curated `plugin-registry/plugins.yaml` pointer source.
The implementation preserves normal coverage for every other registry path and
for any pull request that combines the exempt source with a non-exempt path.

Task 04 verification completed on 2026-09-16:

- 77 validator tests, 7 workflow contract tests, and 9 action-pinning tests passed.
- All 24 workflow files passed action-pinning lint.
- `zizmor .github/workflows/pr-docs.yml` reported no findings.
- The specification catalog and linter passed; `git diff --check` passed.

## Amendment: CI infrastructure paths

The original four work orders remain complete. This amendment exempts the CI
infrastructure paths `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/scripts/**`, and
`.github/actions/**` from requiring a delivery package. CI pipeline changes do
not ship product behavior and are already covered by workflow contract tests,
so requiring delivery context for them adds process without design value. The
exemption is directory-scoped; workflows, scripts, or actions outside `.github/`
still require coverage.

Task 05 implements the exemption and updates the path classifier tests,
requirement, system design, decision record, and plan.

Task 05 verification completed on 2026-09-21:

- 80 validator tests, 7 workflow contract tests, and 9 action-pinning tests passed.
- All 24 workflow files passed action-pinning lint.
- `zizmor .github/workflows/pr-docs.yml` reported no findings.
- The specification catalog and linter passed; `git diff --check` passed.

## Amendment: architecture-lint tooling

The accepted architecture-lint decision places shared linter implementation
under `scripts/` and reviewed baselines under `config/`, where local Make,
pre-commit, and GitHub Actions use the same repository tooling. The existing CI
infrastructure exemption covers only `.github/`, so architecture-lint paths
otherwise require a delivery package because of location alone.

Task 06 adds exact exemptions for `scripts/architecture_lint/**`,
`scripts/architecture_lint_tests/**`, and `config/architecture-lint/**`, plus
`scripts/lint-architecture.py` and `scripts/lint-architecture.test.py`. Other
scripts and configuration remain covered, and any mixed change with a
non-exempt path still requires linked delivery context. Renames continue to
classify both old and new paths, and merge-group members remain independent.

Task 06 verification completed on 2026-09-26:

- 87 validator tests and 7 workflow contract tests passed.
- The specification catalog validated 309 decisions and 1183 specifications;
  the specification linter and `git diff --check` passed.
- A read-only fixture from PR #2234 head
  `ada835c937ed6e57822ba5b8a7fa7239be0834fa` classified all 21 changed paths
  as exempt. GitHub reported the PR as merged during this check. The fixture
  does not publish a GitHub status.

## Risks

- Conservative defaults require labels for some small fixes, refactors, and dependency manifest changes.
- An overly broad registry match could allow schema, generator, or generated-catalog changes to bypass delivery context; exact-path tests constrain this risk.
- The target-branch event queue retains up to 100 pending runs; higher bursts can still cancel new runs.
- Structural validation cannot establish semantic relevance or planning chronology.
- Merge queue boundary resolution needs real payload validation before mandatory rollout.
- GitHub label/status publication is eventually consistent.
- Adding a required status is an administrator operation separate from merging workflow files.
