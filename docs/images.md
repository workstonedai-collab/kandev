# Choosing a Kandev Image

Kandev publishes two container image flavors to GitHub Container Registry. Both are functionally identical kandev - same backend, same web UI, same persistence model. They differ only in what *else* is preinstalled in the image.

`:latest` aliases the vanilla image; `:universal` aliases the latest universal. **Tag pinning is strongly recommended in production** - `:latest` moves and we don't promise it stays the same forever.

## What's in `:universal` (and what's not)

**Language toolchains:** Go (latest stable), Rust (rustup, stable default toolchain), pnpm (preinstalled through npm into `/usr/local` so `pnpm` is on `$PATH` for everyone).

**Build essentials:** `build-essential` (gcc, g++, make, libc-dev), `pkg-config`, `python3-dev`, `libssl-dev`. These cover CGO compilation, native Python pip wheels, and native Node modules.

**Linters and developer CLIs:** `golangci-lint`, `ripgrep`, `fd`, `jq`, `yq`.

**Playwright Chromium system libraries** (browsers themselves are *not* preinstalled - see below).

**Not included:**

- **JDKs / .NET / Mono** - out of scope in v1; if these matter to your workflow, derive your own image (see *Customizing your image* below).
- **Playwright browsers** (`chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`). Run `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` (or whichever browsers you need) once after the container starts. Downloads land at `~/.cache/ms-playwright`, which lives on the PV under `HOME=/data/home` and survives pod restarts. This keeps universal under 1.5 GB; it adds a one-time setup command per agent that wants browsers.
- **Database servers** (Postgres, MySQL, Redis). Use a sidecar or external service.
- **Kandev's own test dependencies beyond what's listed above.** Universal *is* enough to run kandev's backend Go tests, but the Playwright e2e suite needs the user to `pnpm install` and run `playwright install` first, same as on a fresh dev machine.

## Inclusion policy

We add a tool to universal when **all four** of these hold:

1. It's commonly needed by agent-driven dev workflows (Go/Rust/Python/Node project work).
2. It's reasonably available in apt or a well-maintained prebuilt binary.
3. It adds less than 200 MB to the installed image.
4. It doesn't carry a license that conflicts with redistributing the image.

We **decline** additions that fail any of these. The escape hatch is always *derive your own image* - see below.

## Switching between flavors

There is no migration. Both images mount `/data` the same way and use the same database schema. To switch a running deployment:

**Docker:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:X.Y.Z-universal
docker stop kandev && docker rm kandev
docker run -p 38429:38429 -v kandev-data:/data ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:X.Y.Z-universal
```

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
kubectl set image deployment/kandev kandev=ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:X.Y.Z-universal
```

All your data (database, worktrees, npm globals, agent auth state) carries over because it lives on the PV, not in the image.

## Customizing your image

Universal is opinionated. If you need something it doesn't include - a JDK, a private apt repository, a specific Node version, your company's CA cert - **derive your own image** from whichever base fits.

The pattern: a tiny Dockerfile that does `FROM ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:X.Y.Z` (or `…:X.Y.Z-universal`), drops back to root, installs what you need, drops back to `kandev`. Build it, push it to a registry you control, point your deployment at it.

### Recipe: add a JDK on top of universal

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:0.45.0-universal

USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        openjdk-21-jdk-headless \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
USER kandev
```

```bash
docker build -t my-registry.example.com/kandev:0.45.0-jdk .
docker push my-registry.example.com/kandev:0.45.0-jdk
kubectl set image deployment/kandev kandev=my-registry.example.com/kandev:0.45.0-jdk
```

### Recipe: lightweight extras on top of vanilla

If universal is too big for you but you need a couple of specific tools:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:0.45.0

USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        make \
        rsync \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
USER kandev
```

### Recipe: bake a corporate CA cert

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:0.45.0-universal

USER root
COPY corporate-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
RUN update-ca-certificates
USER kandev
```

### Recipe: preinstall a specific agent CLI version

The Settings → Agents *Install* button calls `npm install -g` at runtime. If you want a fixed version baked into the image (so every container starts with it), do it at build time - and install **outside** `/data`, otherwise the named volume mounted at `/data` will shadow your install on every container after the first one is created:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:0.45.0

USER root
# Install to /usr/local (NOT /data/.npm-global, which is on the named volume
# and only seeded on first volume creation). /usr/local/bin is already on
# PATH after /data/.npm-global/bin, so a user-installed runtime version
# would still win if anyone adds one later.
RUN npm install -g --prefix /usr/local @anthropic-ai/claude-code@1.2.3
USER kandev
```

Note: kandev users will see the agent as already installed on the agents page. Baking it in means the version is tied to your image rather than to user choice - if a user runtime-installs a different version, that one wins (because the runtime path `/data/.npm-global/bin` precedes `/usr/local/bin` on `$PATH`).

## What if I need something that doesn't fit any of these patterns?

Two reasonable paths:

1. **Open an issue** suggesting an addition to universal. Cite (a) the workflow that needs it, (b) the installed size, (c) whether it's apt-available or needs a prebuilt binary. We'll evaluate against the inclusion policy.
2. **Just maintain your own derived image.** This is what most teams end up doing for org-specific needs (corporate CAs, internal tools, JDK pinning). It's a 10-line Dockerfile and a 2-line CI step.

## A note on building locally

The repository also contains the source Dockerfiles (`Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.universal`). You can build either locally:

```bash
# Vanilla
docker build -t kandev:dev .

# Universal (depends on a vanilla base - build vanilla first if you want a
# fully-from-source universal, or let BASE_IMAGE default to the published one)
docker build -f Dockerfile.universal --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=kandev:dev -t kandev:dev-universal .
```

In CI we always build vanilla first and pass its tag as `BASE_IMAGE` to the universal build, so a single release run produces a matched `vX.Y.Z` + `vX.Y.Z-universal` pair.
