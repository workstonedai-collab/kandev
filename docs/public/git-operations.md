# Git Operations

Kandev runs Git commands in the selected repository workspace for a task session. The Worktree executor gives a session a dedicated host worktree; Local uses the configured shared checkout, while container and remote executors use runtime-specific workspace behavior described in [Executors](executors.md). The browser sends a WebSocket request to the backend, which forwards it to `agentctl` in that executor. This keeps the command's filesystem, Git configuration, network access, SSH agent, and provider CLI in the same environment as the agent.

Use the task's **Changes** panel to inspect, stage, discard, commit, push, reset, or rename a branch. The task toolbar and command panel also expose **Commit Changes**, **Push**, **Pull**, provider-appropriate pull-request or merge-request creation, **Rebase**, and **Merge** when a Git-capable session is selected.

## Quick path

1. Inspect the selected repository in **Changes**.
2. Stage only the files you intend to commit.
3. Run required checks before pushing or opening a change request.
4. Treat discard, reset, amend, force-push, and cleanup as irreversible or history-changing operations.

The state transitions are separate operations. Inspect the diff before staging, verify checks before pushing, and decide whether cleanup may remove a worktree or other local data.

### When task and PR histories differ

For an associated pull request, Kandev keeps the task checkout and the published PR history
separate when their commit histories differ. It may identify a completed local rebase when the
current repository evidence supports that explanation. If the evidence is missing or incomplete,
Kandev uses neutral wording instead of guessing which history changed.

Choose **Compare versions** first. Kandev opens **Changes** with the task and PR histories visible;
the comparison does not fetch, rewrite, or publish Git history. Review the selected repository,
branch, pull request, and both displayed heads before choosing a replacement action.

**Publish task version...** replaces the published PR history after an exact provider-head check and
confirmation. **Restore published PR version...** replaces the task checkout history, creates a
recovery branch at the current task head first, and requires a clean working tree. If the provider
head changes before confirmation, Kandev leaves both versions unchanged and asks for a fresh review.

## Prerequisites and trust boundary

The repository must be a valid Git checkout in the executor workspace and the session's `agentctl` must be reachable. Remote commands use the remote named `origin`; configure its URL and credentials in the executor where the command runs before relying on Pull, Push, or change-request creation. Rebase and Merge use `origin` when it exists, or a local base branch when it does not. The workspace's provider automation identity does not replace the task's Git credential policy or executor-local SSH setup; see [Executors](executors.md#workspace-automation-identity-and-task-git-transport).

Git commands from the agent shell and Git actions from the **Changes** panel use different permission paths. The Changes panel sends its Git action through Kandev to `agentctl`. It does not run the action inside the agent shell. The agent shell remains subject to the selected agent's permission mode.

In a restricted agent mode, `git status` can work while `git add` or `git commit` fails. These write Git metadata, including `.git/index.lock`.

If the error says that `.git/index.lock` already exists or is held, another Git process can own the lock. Stop other Git operations and inspect the lock before retrying. Remove a stale lock only after you confirm that no Git process owns it. The Changes panel uses the same worktree, so it does not bypass an active lock.

If the agent cannot create `.git/index.lock` because its permission mode blocks the metadata write, the repository and Kandev Git integration can still work.

To commit agent edits, use the **Changes** panel. No mode change is needed. If the agent shell must commit, select an agent mode that allows Git metadata writes. Mode names come from the installed agent. For example, Codex can expose `Agent (default)` and `Agent (full access)`.

Managed Improve Kandev tasks are the exception to the ordinary single-remote push description. The
canonical `origin` still identifies `kdlbs/kandev` for pulls, base comparisons, issue lookup, and
the pull-request target. Before launch, Kandev prepares one exact fork remote for the task branch
and configures Git to use it for pushes. Run ordinary **Push** or `git push`; do not rename `origin`
or replace it with a fork. The PR workflow uses the canonical repository and an explicit
`<fork-owner>:<branch>` head. Other tasks keep the normal `origin` push behavior.

### Compare a fork pull request

When a linked pull request uses a fork, Kandev stores the provider-qualified target repository and
target branch on the exact task-repository attachment. It fetches that branch into a
comparison-only remote-tracking ref. Kandev uses the same repository identity when it prepares a
worktree. Kandev checks the fetched commit against the pull request's reported base commit. It
fetches the pull request head from the base repository. This comparison ref is read-only and is
authoritative for Changes, commits, cumulative diff, and ahead/behind counts.

The comparison target does not replace `origin`, the checked-out branch, or the push route. Kandev
shows the target as `<owner>/<repository>:<branch>` without credentials. If the target cannot be
validated, fetched, or resolved, Kandev marks comparison as unavailable and does not substitute a
same-named branch from `origin`. Numeric comparison totals are hidden until the exact target is
available.

When a provider retargets the pull request, Kandev refreshes the stored target and the live session
comparison. If Kandev cannot fetch the required target or the fetched commit differs from the
provider response, task preparation stops. A stale provider response or a retarget during preparation
can cause this mismatch. Select **Retry launch** to refresh provider data and try preparation again.
If the failure is caused by access or connectivity, restore access or connectivity before retrying.
Kandev does not use an `origin` branch with the same name or start from the repository default.

The qualified target does not replace `origin` or change push routing. A fork PR continues to use
the configured fork for pushes. An explicit cross-repository PR target blocks **Retry with the
default branch**. To retry the same PR base, select **Retry launch**. To clear the PR target, select
a task base branch or remove the owning pull-request association. Kandev does not guess incomplete
fork identity or apply it to another repository.

These UI operations enter through Kandev's `/ws` endpoint. With authentication disabled, anyone who can reach an unprotected backend receives the synthetic administrator identity and can invoke destructive Git actions with the executor's permissions. Experimental authentication adds user and workspace authorization, but it does not restrict the executor's filesystem or credentials. Keep Kandev on loopback or behind an authenticated, origin-protected TLS proxy; see [WebSocket API](websocket-api.md).

Credentials are resolved where `agentctl` runs. A host SSH agent, credential helper, `gh` login, or `az` login is not automatically available inside every Docker, SSH, or remote executor. Give the executor only the repository access it needs and test with a disposable branch. See [Executors](executors.md) for executor-specific credential handling.

When the Worktree executor is selected, its filesystem separation is not a security sandbox. Host worktrees share the repository's Git object database and local refs, and agents can run arbitrary repository commands allowed by their executor.

## Managed worktree and branch lifecycle

This section describes Kandev's Worktree executor and other executor paths that create managed Git workspaces. Local, Docker, remote Docker, SSH, and Sprites have executor-specific checkout, mount, and cleanup behavior; see [Executors](executors.md) before assuming these host paths or isolation properties apply.

By default, managed worktrees live under the configured task-data directory, commonly:

```text
~/.kandev/tasks/{task-directory}/{repository-name}
~/.kandev/tasks/{task-directory}/{repository-name}-{branch-slug}
```

Additional branches are siblings of the primary repository worktree, not directories nested inside it. Multi-repository tasks have one worktree per repository. Kandev reuses a valid session/repository worktree; if its directory is missing, it attempts to recreate it from the recorded local or remote branch.

Managed worktrees can remain registered to an older repository clone after the repository path changes. For supported GitHub and GitLab repositories, Kandev checks the provider origin, linked-worktree registration, branch, and commit. When the worktree is clean, Kandev moves it to the current workspace clone before it starts an agent. Kandev keeps the old checkout.

If the worktree contains local changes, Kandev stops and offers **Move files and resume**. Before you confirm, note that Kandev keeps the original checkout and a file snapshot. Git staging state does not transfer. Review the moved changes before you commit. Kandev blocks worktrees with unsupported filters, sparse checkout, or submodules.

For a new task branch, the repository default template is:

```text
feature/{title}-{suffix}
```

`{title}` is an ASCII-safe, lower-case task-title slug and `{suffix}` is a short collision-avoidance value. Repository settings can change the template. When `pull_before_worktree` is omitted it defaults to `true`: Kandev attempts to refresh and verify the base branch before creating or recreating the worktree. The public configuration defaults both fetch and fast-forward pull timeouts to 60 seconds. When a usable local base exists, authentication, network, timeout, missing-ref, divergent-ref, and uncertain-ancestry errors produce a credential-safe warning and Kandev creates the worktree from that local base. The warning states that remote changes may be missing. When no usable local base exists, Kandev must materialize the requested branch from the remote; a failed refresh or missing remote ref stops task preparation with a repository-specific launch error. Explicit remote-only refs and remote executors keep this strict materialization behavior.
Without an explicit cross-repository target, Kandev uses the current base branch for a numbered GitHub PR. If Git proves that the requested base branch was deleted, Kandev can use a configured fallback branch, often the repository default, only after it refreshes and verifies that fallback. Kandev shows a warning with both branch names. Other PR refresh errors stop preparation.

An explicit fork target has no default fallback. Kandev stops preparation if it cannot fetch or verify that target. Kandev does not create a worktree from an unverified local or remote-tracking branch.

If the repository is intentionally offline, open its workspace repository settings and disable
**Always pull before creating a new worktree**. This skips the refresh attempt for host worktrees,
but it is not required for a normal local-only base. Keep the setting enabled when remote freshness
is important for later task launches.

### Branch names in executor scripts

The `repository.branch` placeholder supplies an upstream branch name to executor scripts.
For example, `origin/main` and `refs/remotes/origin/main` both produce `main` for clone and fetch commands.
This applies to current and saved scripts that use the placeholder.

Kandev removes one recognized prefix. Names such as `feature/login` and `upstream/main` remain unchanged.
Use `refs/heads/origin/topic` to identify a literal upstream branch named `origin/topic`.
The stored task base reference and `worktree.base_branch` remain unchanged.
A missing upstream branch still fails preparation.

### Review a PR in a remote workspace

When you select a GitHub PR for a new remote workspace, Kandev checks out the fetched PR head before the agent starts.
This includes fork PRs on Sprites, Docker, SSH, and Kubernetes.
Kandev fetches the PR head from the base repository and keeps the selected base branch for comparison.

Review checkout does not require permission to push to the fork.
It does not configure a fork push destination or grant edit access.
If the selected PR or branch cannot be fetched, preparation fails instead of starting on the base branch.

Resuming an existing workspace preserves its branch, local commits, and uncommitted changes.
A newly recreated workspace fetches the selected PR again.
Existing workspaces that previously started on the wrong branch are not reset automatically.
### Files remain, but Git metadata is missing

A linked worktree stores its files separately from its Git administrative
directory. Its `.git` file points to an entry under the main repository's
`worktrees` directory.

An incomplete backup restore or manual metadata removal can break this link
without removing the checkout files. Git pruning can also remove administrative
data while a worktree drive is unavailable. This is different from a missing
checkout or a lost branch.

Checkout files alone do not contain the complete Git state. They cannot restore
a lost index, previous staging choices, or commits absent from the object database.
Ignored files can include credentials and require the same protection as source
files.

CAUTION: Do not remove the remaining checkout to clear a metadata error. It can
contain the only copy of uncommitted work. Stop active sessions before manual
recovery, and preserve the checkout and available repository metadata first.

For remote or container executors, the relevant filesystem belongs to that
executor. An identical path on the Kandev host does not identify the same checkout.

### Automatic recovery of missing linked-worktree metadata

For a selected host **Worktree** environment, Kandev can recover a checkout when
the checkout directory still exists, its linked Git administrative directory is
missing, and the recorded branch still resolves in the source repository. Local,
container, SSH, Sprites, Kubernetes, and other remote executor workspaces keep
their own recovery behavior. A remote Git origin does not make an executor remote.

A main repository can also be the selected host **Worktree** checkout. Its `.git`
directory does not require linked-worktree recovery. When Git metadata is valid,
Kandev keeps using the same checkout and does not create recovery artifacts. A
successful relaunch clears the matching task-level launch error.

For missing linked-worktree metadata, Kandev checks every selected repository
slot before it changes any slot. It keeps the original checkout and creates a
sibling recovery worktree with a branch named
`{recorded-branch}-recovered-{operation-prefix}`. It copies tracked, untracked,
and ignored files, deletions, modes, and symbolic links. It does not restore the
old index, staging choices, or commits that are no longer available.

If the checkout directory itself is missing, Kandev uses a separate guarded
recovery path. It requires the selected environment's active worktree record and
the exact recorded branch identity to still resolve in the source repository.
It recreates the original checkout path and branch from that local branch, its
recorded recovery commit, or the matching remote-tracking branch. It does not
substitute the task base branch, fetch a different branch tip, or create a
replacement during attach-only workspace reuse.

If both the local branch and its remote-tracking ref are absent, Kandev checks
the configured origin for the exact recorded branch. It fetches only the
advertised commit and verifies the head before it creates the checkout. A failed
origin check blocks automatic recovery. Confirmed branch loss still requires
the explicit **Resume on a new branch** recovery action.

If recovery stops before the checkout is complete and only the origin branch
remains, Kandev checks that exact branch again on retry. It records the newly
advertised head before fetching it. If the branch advances between that check
and the fetch, the current attempt stops and a later retry checks the branch
again. A surviving local branch stays at its recorded commit.

Before restoring a missing checkout, Kandev verifies every selected repository
slot, confirms the Worktree environment still has exclusive ownership, and
checks that no session or runtime is using it. A live requester, sibling session,
or borrower makes recovery fail before startup. The checkout path and worktree
record stay the same after recovery. Files that existed only in the deleted
directory, including uncommitted, untracked, and ignored content, cannot be
recovered by this process.

Kandev refuses automatic recovery when metadata is ambiguous, the recorded branch
is confirmed unavailable, the environment is busy, the environment owner changed,
or the recovery claim is not current. A multi-repository recovery can retain an earlier
completed slot when a later slot fails, but Kandev does not start an agent with
an incomplete inventory. Recovery records and snapshots remain beside the
original checkout for inspection and can contain ignored files, including
sensitive data.

### Repair inconsistent worktree inventory

A healthy checkout can disagree with its saved branch, repository ID, or task
root. This can produce “advanced from audited commit”, “incomplete worktree
identity”, or “owned by another task” errors. These messages require inspection:
they can also indicate a real ownership or commit change. Repeated resume or
cleanup attempts do not repair inconsistent inventory.

The source maintenance command `cmd/worktree-inventory-repair` supports explicit
repairs for local SQLite installations using the host **Worktree** executor.
Application and rollback require Linux and permission to inspect host processes
across all users through `/proc`. An inaccessible process blocks repair; this can
require a privileged operator. Preview and verification only read state.
Use a backend build containing the repair startup guard before applying a repair.
The utility ignores inherited `GIT_*` environment settings; its plan selects the
repository and checkout paths.

1. Build the utility from `apps/backend`:

   ```bash
   go build -o worktree-inventory-repair ./cmd/worktree-inventory-repair
   ```

2. Prepare a private JSON input using the
   [repair plan fields](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/blob/main/apps/backend/internal/task/inventoryrepair/plan.go).
   Set `version` to `1`, `driver` to `sqlite`, a unique `operation_id`, and absolute
   `home`, `database`, and `tasks_root` paths. Each repair names an exact worktree,
   environment, repository, source path, destination path, attached branch, HEAD
   commit, and source-root task. Every relocation requires a matching `workspaces`
   entry naming the environment's canonical task root and every bound session.
   Include an old cleanup job only when its incomplete snapshot needs a linked
   successor. Omit `expected_rows` and `expected_git` on
   the first preview; the command fills these observations.

3. Review the preview and retain its `plan` object as the application input:

   ```bash
   umask 077
   ./worktree-inventory-repair --plan input.json > preview.json
   jq '.plan' preview.json > repair.json
   ```

   Check the proposed changes and any `blockers`. Preview preserves tracked,
   untracked, and ignored files, the index, refs, and ownership markers.

4. Stop the backend through its normal service or launcher, and stop processes
   using the selected task roots. Refresh and review the preview if state changed.
   Then apply and verify before restarting:

   ```bash
   ./worktree-inventory-repair --plan repair.json --apply
   ./worktree-inventory-repair --plan repair.json --verify
   ```

A held backend lock means an instance still owns the installation. A process
inspection permission error means the utility cannot establish that consumers
are absent; use an authorized account with sufficient visibility. Neither error
is a stale-lock signal. Do not delete ownership locks or bypass these checks.

The command retains a private SQLite backup and journal under
`<home>/inventory-repairs/<operation_id>/`. It moves selected checkouts with
`git worktree move`, preserves their content and refs, and changes only the
selected inventory. When a cleanup snapshot needs repair, its original bytes
remain on the cancelled predecessor; the linked successor captures new source
evidence through the normal cleanup worker.

If interrupted, rerun the same plan with `--apply` to finish or `--rollback` to
reverse it. Changed inventory or checkout content prevents either operation.
An unresolved journal blocks backend startup; retain the journal and backup
until resolved. Startup reports the repair recovery command without suggesting
a second instance. Verify before restarting; online verification may observe
concurrent changes. After restart, check the cleanup job and resume the affected
session. Metadata verification alone does not establish that those operations
have completed. Normal dirty-checkout, branch, and ownership guards still apply.

### Named branch policies

Open **Settings → Workspaces → _workspace_ → Repositories**, edit a repository, and expand
**Branch policies**. A policy names the base branch, branch-name template, and pull-request target.
Policies belong to that repository. Create, edit, and delete actions take effect immediately.
The branch controls list local and remote branches. You can search the list or refresh it from Git.

The base branch is the starting point for the new task branch. The pull-request target is its merge
destination. These values are usually the same. A Gitflow Release policy can start from `develop`
and target `main`.

In **New Task** or **New subtask**, the repository branch picker shows saved policies before raw
branches. Select a policy to create a fresh task branch from its base branch. The policy template
controls the branch name. Raw branches keep their existing checkout behavior. Each policy uses one
line in the picker. Point to or focus its information icon to see the saved values. On touch devices,
tap the icon.

The **Gitflow starter** can create Feature, Bugfix, Hotfix, and Release policies in one operation.
It requires two different existing branches and does not change Git branches. A task stores the
selected policy values when it is created. Later policy edits or deletion do not change that task's
branch or pull-request target. Kandev's pull-request dialog uses the saved target by default. You can
select a different target before creation.

Kandev adds the saved target to the agent's task context. The instruction tells the agent to pass the
target to the provider CLI. For example, a GitHub agent uses `gh pr create --base <target>`. Kandev
does not add a separate shell environment value, and it does not prevent the user from changing the
target.

Policies are not available in **Quick Chat**, **Remote**, **Add Sources**, or **Add Branch** flows.

When a task opens an existing branch or GitHub PR, Kandev fetches that branch; for a numbered GitHub PR it can fetch `refs/pull/NUMBER/head`, including fork PRs. At materialization, Kandev uses the PR's current GitHub base when available. Polling also keeps the task's stored comparison base aligned after GitHub retargets a stacked PR. If the intended branch is already checked out in another worktree, the new worktree uses a suffixed local branch and tracks the original `origin` branch when available. The required-refresh rule still applies before that new worktree is created.

Tasks created without an initial title can expose the one-shot `set_task_title_kandev` handoff when
**Settings → Preferences → Task Behavior → Tasks → Agent-generated task titles** is enabled. After the owning
session accepts its final title, Kandev regenerates Kandev-managed branch names from that title and
updates the stored branch snapshots. It never renames a repository row with an explicit checkout
branch (for example, a GitHub PR branch) or a Local/Local PC checkout. A branch manually selected
before the title call is preserved as well. Multi-repository tasks apply these rules independently to
each repository, and a Git or snapshot persistence failure does not undo the accepted title.

After creation, Kandev copies any repository-configured files and runs its setup script. Setup-script failure is non-fatal: the worktree remains and the session surfaces a warning. Cleanup scripts run before worktree removal, but their failure also does not prevent removal.

### Deleting a task with local worktree changes

Task deletion checks every owned worktree before it changes the task or starts
cleanup. If Git reports tracked or untracked changes, deletion stops and the
task remains visible. The confirmation dialog lists the affected worktrees and
requires an explicit choice to permanently discard those changes before a
retry.

With that choice, Kandev removes the worktree and its local changes only after
it passes the normal path-ownership, Git-registration, checkout-identity,
shared-reference, and branch-safety checks. A branch with unique commits is
preserved. If the checkout becomes dirty after admission, cleanup preserves the
checkout and records a terminal failure instead of retrying the destructive
operation automatically.

## Everyday operations

All operations below run in the selected repository workspace.

| UI operation | Effective Git behavior | Important consequence |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Pull | `git pull origin BRANCH`, optionally with `--rebase`. | Uses the current branch when any upstream exists. With no upstream it falls back to `origin/main`, then `origin/master`, then the current branch. It does not parse an upstream that points to a differently named remote branch. |
| Push | `git push origin CURRENT_BRANCH`; adds `--set-upstream` when requested or no upstream exists. | Force Push uses `--force-with-lease`, not unconditional `--force`. It still rewrites remote history when the lease is valid. Managed Improve Kandev tasks use the branch's prepared fork push remote instead of `origin`. |
| Rebase | If `origin` exists, fetches `origin BASE` and rebases onto `origin/BASE`. Without `origin`, rebases onto the local `refs/heads/BASE`. | Rewrites local commits. If conflict files are detected from Git output, Kandev attempts `git rebase --abort` automatically and returns the file list. |
| Merge | If `origin` exists, fetches `origin BASE` and merges `origin/BASE`. Without `origin`, merges the local `refs/heads/BASE`. | Conflicts are deliberately left in the worktree. Resolve and commit them, or use Abort Merge. |
| Abort | Runs `git merge --abort` or `git rebase --abort`. | Fails when that operation is not in progress or the repository cannot be restored. |
| Stage | With paths, `git add -- PATHS`; with an empty path list, `git add -A`. | Empty means all changes, including deletions. |
| Unstage | With paths, `git reset HEAD -- PATHS`; with an empty path list, `git reset HEAD`. | Keeps working-tree content. |
| Commit | Optionally runs `git add -A`, then `git commit -m MESSAGE`; Amend adds `--amend`. | The normal UI defaults to staging all when it invokes this helper. Amend rewrites `HEAD`. |
| Discard | Restores tracked paths from `HEAD`; added and untracked files are unstaged and deleted. | Removes both staged and unstaged work. Explicit paths are required, but deletion is not recoverable through Kandev. |
| Edit branch | `git branch -m NEW_NAME` for the current local branch. | Does not rename/delete the old remote branch or automatically repair every external reference. Push the new branch explicitly. |

Only one Git operation can run at a time for a given repository operator. A second concurrent request is rejected as “another git operation is already in progress.” Different repositories in a multi-repository workspace have separate operators.

Most Git command failures are normal responses with `success:false`, `error`, and sometimes `conflict_files`; they are not WebSocket transport errors. Read the result body even when the request itself completed. The web client waits 60 seconds for an ordinary Git operation.

### Multi-repository tasks

In a multi-repository task, every wire request must identify one repository with its `repo` subpath. The workspace root is not itself a Git repository, so omitting `repo` normally fails. The UI handles this for you:

- Per-file Stage, Unstage, and Discard are routed to the file's repository.
- Stage All and Unstage All fan out to repositories that have files.
- Commit fans out only to repositories with staged changes.
- Push fans out only to repositories that are ahead.
- Pull, Rebase, Merge, and Abort fan out to all listed repositories.
- The multi-repository toolbar lets you select an individual repository for Commit, Push, Create PR, Pull, Rebase, Merge, or Force Push.

A fan-out can partially succeed. The UI continues after a failure and reports per-repository outcomes; inspect each repository before retrying a history-changing action.

## Commit history and reset behavior

The Changes panel's session history is calculated relative to the session's recorded base commit or current merge base, so it focuses on commits created on the task branch. Kandev refreshes status and emits session Git updates after mutations, but the underlying Git repository remains authoritative.

Two similarly named actions have very different semantics:

- **Revert latest commit** (`worktree.revert_commit`) is not `git revert`. It accepts only the exact current `HEAD` SHA and runs `git reset --soft HEAD~1`, moving the branch back one commit while leaving its changes staged. It creates no inverse commit.
- **Reset to commit** moves `HEAD` to an existing 4–40 character hexadecimal commit SHA. `soft` leaves changes staged, `mixed` leaves them unstaged, and `hard` discards tracked working-tree and index changes. The current UI offers Soft and Hard and requires the short SHA before Hard; the wire handler also accepts Mixed and defaults a missing mode to `mixed`.

Do not reset or amend commits already consumed by other users unless you intend to rewrite and force-push the branch. Kandev hides some revert/reset actions for commits it knows are pushed, but that UI guard is not a repository policy or API authorization boundary.

## Create a pull request or merge request

For an ordinary task, **Create PR** first runs:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin HEAD
```

For a managed Improve Kandev task, the prepared branch push remote replaces
`origin` for this push. Keep `origin` canonical and create the GitHub pull
request with the explicit fork head shown below.

It then selects a provider from the `origin` hostname:

| Provider | Required runtime tools | Creation behavior |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| GitHub | Authenticated `gh` CLI | `gh pr create` with title, body, current head, optional base, and optional `--draft`. Managed Improve Kandev uses `--repo kdlbs/kandev` and an explicit `<fork-owner>:<branch>` head. |
| GitLab | Authenticated `glab` CLI or the active workspace's matching GitLab PAT | Reuses an existing open MR for the same source/target or creates one with title, description, current source, explicit or project-default target, and optional draft state. The configured GitLab origin must match the HTTPS or SSH `origin`. |
| Azure Repos | Authenticated `az` CLI plus the `azure-devops` extension | `az repos pr create` with parsed organization, project, repository, source, optional target, and optional draft. |

Other remote providers are rejected by this action. A normal Git push can still work with another provider. A returned GitHub PR or GitLab MR is asynchronously associated with the originating task repository. Azure creation returns a URL but does not create a provider review association.

Title is required. Body and base branch may be empty. GitHub and Azure delegate an empty base to their provider CLI; GitLab resolves the project default branch before creation. The web UI defaults new change requests to draft and waits up to 120 seconds. Provider credentials and remote push permission must exist in the executor, and Git hooks or branch policies can still reject the push or change request.

For GitLab, Kandev preserves a self-managed connection's scheme and never retries against another host. It prefers `glab` when installed and uses the workspace-injected `GITLAB_TOKEN` REST path when the CLI is absent or its create command fails. The successful WebSocket payload keeps the compatibility field name `pr_url` and adds `provider:"gitlab"`. Association runs after that response; use **Link GitLab merge request** if the MR was created but the link is missing.

<summary>WebSocket operation reference</summary>

## WebSocket operation reference

These are the registered Kandev WebSocket actions. Every payload requires `session_id`; `repo` is optional only for a single-repository workspace.

| Action | Additional payload |
|--------|--------------------|
| `worktree.pull` | `rebase` boolean |
| `worktree.push` | `force` and `set_upstream` booleans; optional `remote` (configured remote name or exact configured push URL) and `expected_branch` (current-branch precondition) |
| `worktree.rebase` | required `base_branch` |
| `worktree.merge` | required `base_branch` |
| `worktree.abort` | `operation`: exactly `merge` or `rebase` |
| `worktree.commit` | required non-empty `message`; `stage_all`; `amend` |
| `worktree.stage` | `paths` list; empty means all |
| `worktree.unstage` | `paths` list; empty means all |
| `worktree.discard` | required non-empty `paths` list |
| `worktree.create_pr` | required `title`; `body`; `base_branch`; `draft`; response can include `pr_url` and `provider` (`github`, `gitlab`, or `azure_repos`) |
| `worktree.revert_commit` | required `commit_sha`, which must be exact `HEAD` |
| `worktree.rename_branch` | required `new_name` |
| `worktree.reset` | required `commit_sha`; `mode` is `soft`, `mixed`, or `hard` |

The optional push target fields apply to the WebSocket action and the backend
API. An explicit target uses the expected branch as the destination and does
not set upstream tracking. A branch mismatch returns the expected and current
branch values. Existing contribution routing takes precedence over an explicit
target.

Read-only Git actions used by the Changes panel include `session.commit_diff`, `session.git.commits`, `session.cumulative_diff`, and `session.git.snapshots`. See [WebSocket API](websocket-api.md) for transport and subscription behavior.

`agentctl` also implements `/api/v1/git/*` HTTP routes inside the execution runtime. Those routes are an internal backend-to-runtime control surface, not the public Kandev backend API. External clients should not discover or expose executor-local agentctl ports; use the registered Kandev WebSocket actions.

## Cleanup and data loss

Worktree cleanup audits the Git worktree and checkout before it runs the repository cleanup script. It then removes the Git worktree directory and may remove the local branch:

- Normal task deletion audits each owned worktree before mutation. Tracked or untracked changes stop deletion and keep the task, checkout, and local branch in place until the user explicitly consents to discard them. With consent, cleanup removes the checkout only after the normal ownership and identity audits pass. A clean branch is removed only when its current commit is already contained by the recorded base or repository default; a clean branch with unique commits is preserved after its checkout is reclaimed. Remote branches are never deleted.
- **Reset Environment** is allowed only when no task session is `STARTING` or `RUNNING`. It can optionally push first; a failed requested push aborts the reset. Teardown removes the worktree, preserves unpublished or ambiguous local work, and removes a Kandev-owned local branch only when its exact head is already contained in the recorded integration ref. The next launch materializes a fresh environment.
- Office handoff cleanup uses the same fail-closed local-branch policy when it releases a worktree.

Archive cleanup uses that policy too. If a task is archived before integration, the branch remains. A later full storage-maintenance run can revisit a bounded set of those archived rows and remove the exact local ref after integration is proven. Ref deletion includes the expected head SHA, so an external branch update causes retention instead of deleting the changed ref. Kandev never removes a remote ref through this cleanup.

Before deleting a task or performing a hard reset, commit and push anything you need. Without discard consent, Kandev does not start a cleanup job when the audit finds uncommitted or untracked work. With consent, cleanup scripts run only after the normal worktree audit and perform transient teardown; files they create are removed with the audited checkout. If an audited cleanup script fails, Kandev logs the failure and continues with the same recorded worktree. An audited directory is removed through its pinned no-follow handle, and un-audited fallback cleanup can remove a managed directory without following replacement links. Git metadata is then pruned. Registration pruning and local-branch deletion are verified before the durable cleanup job succeeds; a partial failure remains retryable.

## Troubleshooting

- **No agent/client available:** launch or prepare the session and confirm its executor is healthy. Workspace Git actions can reconstruct runtime control after a backend restart, but still need a valid task environment.
- **Remote/authentication error during worktree preparation:** test `git fetch origin` inside the same executor workspace. Verify the remote URL, SSH agent or key, known-hosts entry, token or credential-helper availability, DNS, and firewall access there. Do not paste command output containing tokens or authenticated URLs into a task or issue.
- **Noninteractive Git authentication failure:** Kandev-owned Git commands finish with a bounded error when the selected executor credential source cannot authenticate. Repair the SSH, credential-helper, or eligible host GitHub access in that same executor and retry the operation. Kandev does not replace credentials or switch transports after the failure. Existing host bridge registration can recover on a later operation; when registration was skipped, launch, resume, or prepared-start re-evaluates it. See [Choose task Git credentials](integrations.md#choose-task-git-credentials) for the credential scope.
- **Comparison target unavailable:** local Changes and local file status remain usable while a fork comparison target is unavailable. The target's commits, diff, ahead/behind values, and numeric totals remain unavailable until authentication recovers. Refresh Changes or request fresh status to trigger the one explicit re-evaluation; Kandev does not substitute a same-named `origin` branch.
- **Host GitHub SSH setup:** for host-based Git credentials, run `gh config set git_protocol ssh --host github.com`, restart Kandev, and retry the task. For Docker, SSH, or Sprites, configure the same Git and SSH access in that executor instead of relying on the host.
- **Merge or Rebase without `origin`:** the selected base branch must exist locally. If it does not, Kandev returns `base branch "BASE" does not exist locally` before changing history. If `origin` exists, Kandev does not fall back to a local branch after a fetch or authentication error.
- **Pull fetched the wrong branch:** Kandev always uses `origin` and, once any upstream exists, the current local branch name. Align local and remote branch names or use an explicit terminal command.
- **Rebase failed but no rebase remains:** detected rebase conflicts are auto-aborted. Use the returned `conflict_files`, resolve with a manual workflow, or merge instead.
- **Merge remains conflicted:** this is expected. Resolve and commit, or choose Abort Merge. Do not start another Git operation until the repository is consistent.
- **Change-request creation failed after push:** the branch may already be remote. Fix `gh`, `glab`, GitLab workspace-token, or `az` authentication as applicable, then retry without assuming the push was rolled back. GitLab retries reuse an existing open MR with the same source and target.
- **Operation timed out:** inspect status before retrying. A client timeout or lost WebSocket response does not prove the underlying command did nothing.
- **Multi-repository operation failed at workspace root:** choose the repository in the toolbar or include its exact `repo` subpath in the request.
- **Missing work after cleanup:** inspect a retained local branch or the remote branch if it was pushed. On unarchive, Kandev recreates a safely compacted managed branch from its recorded exact head before trying remote recovery. Task deletion may already have force-deleted the local branch.
