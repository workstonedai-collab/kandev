# SystemInfo Query Cache

## Purpose and boundaries

This design records the bounded frontend ownership contract for the read-only
SystemInfo resource. It defines an internal state and cache boundary and adds
no independent product requirement. The [backend restart page recovery
design](backend-restart-page-recovery.md) owns process-generation detection and
the reload-required behavior.

The pilot covers only `GET /api/v1/system/info` and the About view. Zustand
continues to own database, jobs, storage, metrics, backups, and other System
state. The [ownership decision](../../../decisions/2026-09-26-system-info-query-cache-ownership.md)
records rationale and alternatives.

## Components and responsibilities

- `SystemInfoQueryProvider` lives in the authenticated app branch. It creates
  one stable QueryClient for the mounted app branch and keeps shell descendants
  mounted when backend or auth identity changes.
- `useSystemInfo` reads and refreshes the SystemInfo Query cache. It does not
  write data back to Zustand.
- `AboutCard` remains the presentation consumer and preserves its current
  loading and metadata display.
- `fetchSystemInfo` and `fetchJson` remain the transport path. The query passes
  TanStack Query's observer AbortSignal through `RequestInit.signal`; no API
  transport contract changes.
- `BackendGenerationGuard` remains the owner of reconnect identity checks. The
  self-update and restart flows keep their explicit no-store reads.

## Data and identity

The query key includes the canonical full backend API base URL, the document's
stable `bootId`, auth mode, authenticated state, and user ID. SystemInfo is not
scoped to a workspace. The provider keeps one QueryClient for the authenticated
app branch instead of keying the provider subtree by identity, so an identity
change does not remount unrelated shell state. When identity changes, the
provider targets only obsolete SystemInfo keys, calls `cancelQueries`, then
immediately calls `removeQueries` with the same filter in that effect. It does
not defer removal to the cancellation promise, so a delayed cleanup cannot
remove a query after that identity becomes current again. The hook moves to the
new identity key, so old data cannot be rendered as the new identity's result.
Auth-gated navigation unmounts the provider when the app shell is left. TanStack
also cancels a pending query when its last observer leaves because the query
function consumes the observer signal. No custom request controller or
StrictMode replay guard is used.

The Go boot payload is unchanged and does not include SystemInfo. It supplies
only `runtime.bootId` for the existing restart guard and query identity. The
About view fetches SystemInfo lazily from the existing authenticated endpoint
when the query first mounts.

## Control flow and freshness

On the About view's first mount, the query calls
`fetchSystemInfo({ cache: "no-store", init: { signal } })`, with `signal` from
TanStack Query's query function context. TanStack Query deduplicates concurrent
consumers and retains one in-memory snapshot. Loading, error, and explicit
refresh state come from the query. If identity changes or logout removes the
last observer while a request is pending, TanStack cancels the query through
that signal. Identity-change cleanup also removes snapshots for other
identities from the client in the same effect; cleanup does not leave a
removal promise pending across subsequent identity changes. A request that has
already completed needs no cancellation.

All fields in the SystemInfo response are fixed for a backend process: build
metadata, runtime version/platform values, process start time, and process ID.
The query can keep that snapshot fresh for the page generation. The query uses
`networkMode: "always"` so an initial request runs even when the browser reports
offline. Automatic retries and reconnect refetch stay disabled, so a settled
offline failure is not resumed on reconnect. Concurrent consumers share a
request.
In development StrictMode, observer replay may cancel an in-flight request and
start a replacement when the observer returns. The query follows TanStack's
signal lifecycle without a second request controller. An explicit refresh
refetches the resource. On every successful WebSocket connection,
`BackendGenerationGuard` continues its independent no-store request. A changed
boot ID enters the existing reload-required flow, and the next document gets a
new identity and cache.

## Security and failure handling

Failed query requests remain visible through the hook's error value; the About
view keeps its current empty metadata fallback. Manual refresh is also the
retry path. No new data is added to public or authenticated boot payloads.
