# Runtime failure attribution requirements

## Overview

Several operational warnings identify a failed operation but not the boundary
that failed. Platform owns the cross-cutting diagnostic contract. The owning
systems retain their health, webhook, repository, and recovery behavior.

## Requirements

### REQ-PLATFORM-RUNTIME-FAILURE-ATTRIBUTION-001: Bounded failure attribution

**Intent:** An operator can distinguish a host-side failure, a plugin response,
an identity rejection, and expected non-recovery without exposing request data.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-PLATFORM-RUNTIME-FAILURE-ATTRIBUTION-001.1:** When a required persistence
  probe fails, one bounded diagnostic shall identify the failing probe stage,
  elapsed time, error class, and writer/reader connection-pool pressure. The
  existing health transition and recovery behavior shall remain unchanged.
- **AC-PLATFORM-RUNTIME-FAILURE-ATTRIBUTION-001.2:** When a plugin webhook
  returns a server error, a diagnostic shall distinguish host lifecycle failure,
  host RPC failure, and a plugin-supplied response. It shall identify the plugin
  and status without logging webhook keys, request contents, or credentials.
- **AC-PLATFORM-RUNTIME-FAILURE-ATTRIBUTION-001.3:** When a live pull request is
  rejected by the task-repository identity guard, a bounded diagnostic shall
  identify the comparison that failed. The same mismatch shall continue to
  block launch or follow the existing safe fallback path.
- **AC-PLATFORM-RUNTIME-FAILURE-ATTRIBUTION-001.4:** When startup session
  recovery finishes below its inventory count, diagnostics shall distinguish
  retracked records from records not retracked and classify known reasons.
  Unknown liveness shall not be treated as absence or trigger cleanup.
- **AC-PLATFORM-RUNTIME-FAILURE-ATTRIBUTION-001.5:** When successful runtime
  enumeration finds no instance matching a recovery candidate, the summary
  shall distinguish that result from failed enumeration, identity rejection,
  and an unclassified backend omission. Each candidate shall contribute to at
  most one terminal summary category. Missing runtime inventory shall not be
  represented as successful empty enumeration or proof of process death.
- **AC-PLATFORM-RUNTIME-FAILURE-ATTRIBUTION-001.6:** When worktree cleanup cannot
  inspect Git state, its diagnostic shall distinguish failure to start Git,
  unavailable repository context, command failure, and cancellation or deadline
  from a verified absent reference. Ownership and changed-commit refusals shall
  remain distinguishable. Diagnostics shall preserve cleanup evidence and
  existing retry and deletion-safety policy.

## Out of scope

- Changing probe timeouts or readiness policy before the database stall is attributed.
- Changing plugin-provided webhook responses or external plugin manifests.
- Relaxing the pull-request identity guard or suppressing the startup progress warning.
