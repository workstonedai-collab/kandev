# MCP Bridge Reliability Requirements

## Overview

Kandev agents use a local MCP server in agentctl. Backend-backed tools cross an
internal WebSocket bridge before the backend handles them.

The agent system owns this contract because the bridge is part of every
Kandev-managed agent runtime. Task and integration systems own the behavior of
their tools after the bridge delivers a request.

## Terminology

- **MCP bridge:** The request and response path between the agentctl MCP server
  and the Kandev backend.
- **Backend stream:** The WebSocket connection that carries MCP requests from
  agentctl to the backend and returns correlated responses.

## Requirements

### REQ-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001: Reliable backend-backed MCP delivery

**Intent:** An agent must receive a result or a descriptive bridge error when
it calls a Kandev tool. A lost internal request must not consume the outer MCP
client timeout without diagnostic evidence.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001.1:** When a new or recovered agent
  stream receives an MCP request, Kandev shall use the current configured
  dispatcher. Startup order shall not leave the stream bound to an earlier
  empty dispatcher.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001.2:** When no backend stream consumes
  an MCP request, agentctl shall return a descriptive error within five
  seconds and shall record the action at the default log level.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001.3:** When the backend stream has no
  MCP dispatcher, Kandev shall return a correlated error response and shall
  record the request identity at the default log level.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001.4:** When a dispatcher returns no
  response for a request, Kandev shall return a correlated error response. It
  shall not silently discard the request.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001.5:** When the backend stream closes
  before a response arrives, agentctl shall fail each request owned by that
  stream with a descriptive disconnect error.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001.6:** Successful tool results and
  intentional user or parent question waits shall keep their current behavior.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001.7:** Default logs shall identify the
  action, request, and session for accepted requests and terminal bridge
  errors. These logs shall not contain tool arguments.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-001.8:** During backend startup, recovered
  and newly launched agents shall have a fully configured, scoped backend MCP
  dispatcher before their streams can request tools. Initial tool discovery
  shall not fail solely because backend handler registration is still pending.
  Failed initialization shall prevent those consumers from starting and shall
  preserve unsuccessful readiness.

### REQ-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002: Empty response payload reporting

**Intent:** A backend client must report an empty response payload as a bridge
error when a caller expects a result. It must not turn an empty payload into a
successful result with an unset value.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.1:** When a successful response has
  zero payload bytes and the caller supplied a result sink, the backend client
  shall return an error.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.2:** The error shall identify the
  empty-payload condition and include the action name. It shall not include the
  request payload or any tool argument.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.3:** When the caller supplied no
  result sink, a zero-byte payload shall keep the existing successful behavior.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.4:** An error response shall keep the
  existing backend-error behavior, even when its payload has zero bytes.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.5:** A valid empty object shall keep
  decoding successfully. The task-plan tool shall keep its current no-plan
  text for that object.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.6:** A valid `null` payload shall keep
  its current decoding behavior and shall not become an empty-payload error.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.7:** A non-empty invalid or
  unassignable payload shall keep returning its decoding error.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.8:** The channel and dispatcher
  backend clients shall use the same response classification rules.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.9:** Each empty-payload error shall
  create one warning with the request ID and action. The channel client shall
  also include the session ID and duration. Warnings shall not include tool
  arguments.
- **AC-AGENTS-MCP-BRIDGE-RELIABILITY-002.10:** The error shall reach the caller
  on its first occurrence. This behavior shall add no retry or backoff.

## Out of scope

- Deadlines for task, integration, plugin, or agent-launch business operations.
- A new user-interface alert for a stalled MCP request.
- Traffic between an agent and a third-party MCP server.
- Treating valid `null` payloads as transport errors.
- Reproducing or assigning a root cause to a historical empty-result incident.
