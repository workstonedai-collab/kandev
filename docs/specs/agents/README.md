# Agent system

## Purpose

The agent system owns configured agent identities, profiles, roles, permissions,
provider capabilities, and agent-facing runtime contracts.

## Ownership

This system owns agent profile data, role governance, profile-backed utility
agents, provider model options, agent permissions, and the agent capability
surface shared by task and Office consumers. Provider-neutral background-work
identity, observations, and capabilities belong here; task storage and UI consume
them without owning protocol semantics. Existing prompt admission and public
session-activity authority remain with Tasks and Platform.

## Exclusions

- Durable work items and workflow transitions belong to the [task and workflow
  system](../tasks/README.md).
- Autonomous Office identities and dashboards belong to the [Office
  system](../office/README.md).
- Presentation-only behavior belongs to the [UI system](../ui/README.md).



## Migration record

Migration remains in progress while legacy source detail is extracted from the
canonical requirement and system-design documents. Use the catalog command to
find current sources.

- [Settings parity](../platform/requirements/agent-settings-parity.md): owns the
  shared discovery and interface contract. Agents retain profile data ownership.
- [Tasks](../tasks/README.md): consumes agent profiles for task execution.
- [Office](../office/README.md): consumes agent identities for autonomous work.
- [Platform](../platform/README.md): owns shared process and runtime services.
- [Costs](../costs/README.md): owns usage accounting and conversation cost projections from normalized provider observations.
