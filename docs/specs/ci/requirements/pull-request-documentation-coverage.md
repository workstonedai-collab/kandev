# Pull request documentation coverage requirements

## Overview

Contributors must include the delivery record for changes that need design context.
The CI system owns the coverage check, automatic exemptions, and label override.
Contributors can write the artifacts manually; use of the repository harness is optional.

## Terminology

- **Full evaluation:** Reading the current pull request state, changed files, and linked delivery artifacts to calculate a documentation coverage result.
- **Transient GitHub failure:** A transport failure, HTTP 408 or 429 response, retryable server response, HTTP 403 response that GitHub identifies as rate limiting, or a merge-queue GraphQL error with type `RATE_LIMITED`.

## Requirements

### REQ-CI-PR-DOCS-001: Predictable artifact coverage

**Intent:** Require reviewable context without requiring new specifications for every correction.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.1:** Every open pull request shall receive a documentation coverage result, including drafts and forks.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.2:** A pull request containing only recognized documentation, tests, translation catalogs, dependency lock, harness, or CI workflow, script, or action changes shall pass without a delivery package.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.3:** Other changes shall require an added or modified work order, its plan, and linked requirements and system designs. Changing the title to `fix`, `chore`, or `refactor` shall not exempt the change.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.4:** Existing plans and specifications shall qualify when the work order references them and they exist in the proposed revision. Contributors shall update contracts when behavior changes, but shall not need meaningless edits to unchanged contracts.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.5:** A deleted artifact, empty file, unresolved reference, unrelated unlinked document, or work order without requirement and acceptance references shall not satisfy coverage.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.6:** The result shall identify triggering paths, accepted references, missing artifacts, and corrective steps. Structural coverage shall not claim semantic completeness or prove that planning preceded coding.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.7:** A pull request that changes only `plugin-registry/plugins.yaml` and other already exempt paths shall pass without a delivery package. Any additional non-exempt path shall continue to require coverage.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.8:** A pull request that changes only recognized CI infrastructure paths under `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/scripts/**`, or `.github/actions/**` shall pass without a delivery package. Any additional non-exempt path shall continue to require coverage.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-001.9:** A pull request that changes only architecture-lint tooling under `scripts/architecture_lint/**`, `scripts/architecture_lint_tests/**`, or `config/architecture-lint/**`, the exact entrypoints `scripts/lint-architecture.py` and `scripts/lint-architecture.test.py`, and already exempt paths shall pass without a delivery package. Any additional non-exempt path shall continue to require coverage.

### REQ-CI-PR-DOCS-002: Explicit documentation exception

**Intent:** Let repository label managers waive unnecessary documentation work.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-002.1:** When the exact label `no-docs-allow` is present, the coverage policy shall pass and identify the override in its result.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-002.2:** Adding or removing the label shall reevaluate the current pull request without requiring a new commit. Removal shall restore normal evaluation.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-002.3:** The label shall remain effective across pushes until removed. The workflow shall not add, remove, or grant permission to apply it.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-002.4:** The exception shall affect only documentation coverage. Other validation and merge requirements shall remain independent.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-002.5:** When an exception-label change targets a branch without a configured merge queue, reevaluation shall finish using the pull request's own coverage result without requiring a merge-group result.

### REQ-CI-PR-DOCS-003: Reliable enforcement

**Intent:** Make the result usable as a required check without trusting contributor execution.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.1:** The result shall belong to the evaluated revision. A stale event shall not publish a success for a newer revision.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.2:** Missing or incomplete evaluation data shall produce an error, never an automatic exemption.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.3:** The check shall evaluate contributor content as data and shall not execute contributor code with repository write credentials.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.4:** A merge group shall pass only when every included pull request meets its own coverage policy or has its own override. One pull request's artifacts or label shall not exempt another.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.5:** Required-check rollout shall include evidence that ordinary PRs, label changes, forks, and merge groups report the expected result.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.6:** When a GitHub request has a transient failure, the evaluator shall retry a bounded number of times. It shall honor usable server wait guidance. For a secondary rate limit without usable guidance, it shall wait at least 60 seconds before retrying.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.7:** When a GitHub request has a permanent failure, requires an excessive wait, or exhausts its retries, the result shall be an infrastructure error. The bounded diagnostic shall identify the request class, response status, and retry outcome. It shall not expose credentials or document contents.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.8:** A failed coverage job shall identify its result category and a bounded failure reason in the runner log without exposing credentials or document contents.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.9:** A label-triggered run shall not publish success on the pull request revision before it finishes the affected merge-group lookup and evaluation. If required queue data cannot be read, the pull request revision shall receive an error result. An affected group's policy failure shall remain on that group's status and shall not change the pull request's own coverage decision.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-003.10:** Label-triggered group reevaluation shall publish group results in a status context distinct from the pull request coverage context, so results cannot overwrite each other when they share a commit revision.

### REQ-CI-PR-DOCS-004: Request-efficient evaluation

**Intent:** Reduce GitHub API pressure without weakening exact-revision validation.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-004.1:** Within one pull request revision or merge-group member evaluation, the system shall reuse the initial pull request snapshot and each repeated artifact lookup.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-004.2:** When a changed requirement keeps its trusted base identity, the system shall resolve it from the exact-head and base documents. It shall not make a GitHub code-search request for that requirement.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-004.3:** When a requirement is new, moved, unresolved, or ambiguous, the system shall use bounded fallback lookup and shall preserve missing-definition and duplicate-definition failures.
- **AC-CI-PR-DOCS-004.4:** A full evaluation shall run after pull request creation, reopening, revision changes, base-branch retargets, exact exception-label transitions, manual retries, and merge-group checks. It shall not run after title or description edits, draft-readiness changes, or unrelated label changes.

## Out of scope

- AI classification of feature intent or documentation quality.
- Enforcing the historical order of planning and implementation commits.
- Requiring public user documentation for every code change. Existing public-docs review obligations continue.
- Automatically changing repository rulesets, labels, merge queue membership, or PR #3137.

## Implementation plans

- [GitHub API resilience](../../../plans/github-api-resilience/plan.md)
