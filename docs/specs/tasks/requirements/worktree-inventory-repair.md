# Worktree inventory repair requirements

## Overview

An older installation can retain healthy Git checkouts whose saved repository,
branch, or task-root identities disagree with the filesystem. Cleanup and resume
must continue to refuse uncertain ownership. An operator needs a bounded repair
that restores agreement while preserving the work and the previous audit record.
The task system owns this contract because task environments own the inventory
used by session admission and durable cleanup jobs.

This is explicit maintenance of selected records. It does not extend automatic
[Git metadata recovery](worktree-metadata-recovery.md) to foreign task roots.

## Requirements

### REQ-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-001: Exact, reversible inventory repair

**Intent:** Repair selected legacy records without adopting or losing unrelated work.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-001.1:** Inspection shall identify the exact
  environment, repository slot, saved and observed branch, checkout, and root
  owner. Preview shall not modify the database, checkouts, refs, or ownership markers.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-001.2:** Application shall require an explicit
  repair description with expected original identities and proposed replacements.
  A changed record, ambiguous repository, live backend, live workspace consumer,
  unsafe path, or unverifiable Git registration shall refuse application.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-001.3:** Repair shall preserve all commits,
  existing refs, tracked, untracked, and ignored files, the index, modes, and links.
  It shall not change HEAD, reset a checkout, or turn an old task root into a
  different task's root by overwriting its ownership marker.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-001.4:** A checkout explicitly selected for
  relocation into its shared environment's canonical root shall keep its content
  and Git registration. Only its exact inventory slot and dependent workspace
  references shall change. Every relocation shall explicitly include a workspace
  repair for its environment and every bound session. Parent-child membership
  alone shall not authorize automatic adoption of a foreign root.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-001.5:** Repair shall retain a private backup
  and durable progress record. Interruption shall allow the same operation to
  continue or roll back after identity checks; it shall not permit the backend
  to serve a partially repaired inventory.

### REQ-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-002: Audit-preserving cleanup recovery

**Intent:** Resume the affected cleanup without rewriting historical evidence.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-002.1:** A repository identity repair shall
  be accepted only for one authorized repository whose Git registration and
  common directory match the exact selected checkout. Missing or competing
  candidates shall leave the original records and checkout unchanged.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-002.2:** Repair shall retain the original
  cleanup snapshot and any source manifest. An incomplete old job that needs
  different evidence shall be superseded by a linked recovery attempt observing
  the current state; new observations shall not be presented as historical ones.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-002.3:** After repair, cleanup shall still
  require current archive identity, no active borrowers, proven path ownership,
  a clean checkout, and the normal source-capture and branch-preservation rules.
  A genuine change to an audited branch or checkout shall still block removal.

### REQ-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-003: Accurate recovery diagnostics

**Intent:** Distinguish an already-absent execution from a failed stop operation.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-003.1:** When a cleanup stop identifies an
  execution as absent through the runtime's typed result, the executor shall not
  emit a failed-stop warning. The result shall remain identifiable to its caller.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKTREE-INVENTORY-REPAIR-003.2:** A timeout, transport error, unknown
  liveness, or other stop failure shall remain a visible failure and continue to
  prevent destructive cleanup where required by the runtime cleanup contract.

## Exclusions

- General automatic worktree adoption, remote filesystem repair, or PostgreSQL
  maintenance tooling in this package.
- Weakening [source evidence](archive-source-manifest.md),
  [runtime cleanup](runtime-cleanup.md), or
  [archive preservation](dirty-worktree-archive.md) requirements.
- New browser controls, provider conversation resets, branch deletion, force
  cleanup, or automatic restart of the user's active backend.
