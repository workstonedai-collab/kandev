# Task Completion System Design

## Purpose and boundaries

The task system owns workflow completion and conversation admission. Runtime
shutdown releases execution resources; it does not establish permanent loss of
conversation access. Agent runtime restoration and workspace recovery retain
their current owners and authorization checks.

| Requirement | Design sections |
| --- | --- |
| `REQ-TASKS-COMPLETION-001` | Step contract, Migration, Entry and notification |
| `REQ-TASKS-COMPLETION-002` | Explicit resume, Follow-up ownership, Cleanup and races, User interface |
| `REQ-TASKS-COMPLETION-003` | Workspace admission, Workspace runtime continuity, Workspace failure feedback |

## Step contract

Use `CompleteTaskOnEnter bool` and `complete_task_on_enter` in JSON, YAML, and
SQL. The naming follows `cancel_triggers_turn_complete`. Responses and current
exports include false explicitly. PATCH uses presence-aware decoding: omission
preserves the value, false disables it, and explicit null is rejected.
Create defaults an omitted value to false and rejects null or non-booleans.

Completion requires both final-step eligibility and an enabled setting.
Persist the setting on its step across reorder operations, but ignore it while
that step is non-final. The new final step uses its own saved value; reordering
does not transfer or automatically enable completion. The editor derives
visibility from the current draft order, and the backend evaluates the committed
order. Saving or discarding the order and settings uses existing coordination.

Carry the field through both task and workflow step models, `StepDefinition`,
the embedded workflow loader, task DTO conversion, workflow controller request
types, `stepevents`, MCP schemas and handlers, and all repository projections.
`workflow_steps.complete_task_on_enter` uses the repository's integer boolean
convention with a non-null zero default. Both repositories initialize this
shared table; neither constructor may erase or bypass migration decisions.

Frontend types, workflow API, boot hydration, WebSocket merges, step drafts,
save/rollback, workflow creation, and duplication carry the same boolean.
Partial WebSocket updates that omit it retain the saved value.

Portable export advances to version 2. Each version-2 step requires a boolean
completion field. Import and sync accept versions 1 and 2. At the version-1
boundary only, omitted values are materialized using the old name-and-final
predicate; explicit false always wins. Reject null in either version.
Normalize the whole workflow before converting individual steps, because legacy
final-position detection needs all steps. Export always emits version 2.
Thus current authored definitions never depend on names at runtime.

Sync applies normalized values and includes the field in equality checks.
Version-1 sync files remain authoritative legacy input until their authors
upgrade them; local editing of synced rows stays disabled. An invalid version-2
file follows existing freeze-and-report sync behavior.

Built-in YAML declares the field explicitly for every step. Preserve each
template's old behavior: qualifying final steps are true; other steps are false.
Do not make the final PR step in Improve Kandev terminal merely because it is
last. Update stored template definitions and workspace bootstrap paths too.

## Migration

The workflow repository owns the semantic backfill, after required additive
schema changes and before serving requests or starting sync. Task repository
projection/bootstrap initialization adds the same column before its own writers
need it. It does not independently infer or backfill completion.

Use one transaction and a durable `kandev_meta` key,
`workflow_complete_task_on_enter_backfill_v1`. Inside the transaction, read the
marker, backfill legacy steps and stored template JSON, then record completion.
Use the existing portable Go normalization for trimmed case-insensitive names
and final position. A final step has no sibling with a greater position,
matching `GetNextStepByPosition`; tied maximum positions retain that definition.
Preserve row timestamps and IDs. The transaction rolls back the marker and all
backfill writes on failure. Startup fails if this required migration fails.

Replay skips the semantic backfill after the marker. It must not use
`WHERE complete_task_on_enter = 0` as a recurring migration. Fresh startup writes
explicit built-in values and records the marker before ordinary user writes.
Template backfill preserves unrelated JSON fields and respects explicit values.
Required-store conformance covers actual constructor order, fresh SQLite and
PostgreSQL, old-schema upgrade, replay after disabling, and failure/retry.
Historical release fixtures remain truthful snapshots; add assertions or a
dedicated legacy fixture rather than editing old releases to contain new columns.

## Entry and notification

Replace the name test in `IsTerminalStep` with the explicit boolean while
retaining final-position eligibility. A step completes work only when it has
no successor and its setting is true.
Keep the old name predicate private to legacy conversion/migration. Audit all
callers, including task creation, `task/service.service_workflow`,
`orchestrator.workflow_store`, queued moves, automated transitions, and
`task_launch_workflow`. Every caller must resolve the actual successor or
equivalent final-position evidence; passing nil without a lookup is not proof.

Persist step and task-state changes through existing guarded transition and
ledger operations. A checked final entry completes a nonterminal task; an
unchecked or non-final entry follows existing nonterminal/reopen behavior.
Do not convert FAILED or
CANCELLED to success. Saving the checkbox does not reevaluate resident tasks.
Do not add transition actions or replay on-enter during Resume.

Parent rollups and dependencies use committed task state. Remove name- or
step-membership fallback from `annotateTerminalChildSteps` and terminal receipt
handling. Preserve `DependencyStatusForTask`'s existing state-only resolution.
Completion events follow the
successful state write, never a speculative target lookup. Preserve existing
operation deduplication, failure/cancellation rollups, archived-child filtering,
and success-only dependency launches. Upgrade does not rewrite resident tasks
or fire old completion events; pre-existing persisted completion stays intact.

## Explicit resume

Reuse `session.recover` with `action: resume`. Admit completed recovery only
through this explicit operation or a session-pinned follow-up send. Carry a
narrow internal completed-resume permission through `LaunchSession` and
`executor.ResumeOptions`; automatic `session.ensure`, status reads, generic
open-time launch, and startup recovery never infer that permission.

Authorize the task/session pair and prompt access before side effects. Under
the existing lifecycle/cancel guards, reload the exact session and task, verify
archive and runtime ownership, and claim the current completed state/version.
Require the expected execution generation as well as state where a callback
can replace the session during recovery. Do not weaken global terminal guards.

Extend `allowsSessionStartingRecovery` only for an explicitly claimed completed
resume. Permit absent `executors_running` after cleanup; retain recoverable task
environment and profile checks. Reuse stale-execution cleanup, provider token
restoration, and native/CLI/history fallback. Persist `STARTING` and clear
`CompletedAt` through the guarded writer before credentials are issued. Retain
prior execution and turn history; do not clear ACP/provider identity.

At readiness, settle into the existing input-capable state without sending a
synthetic workflow or task-description prompt. Preserve current initial-message
backfill only for genuinely absent launch history. The next user send starts
one new conversational turn after the old one. No new session ID or queue
incarnation is allocated by Resume.

`message_target_session.go` continues to prefer live primary, then live
fallback. Completed siblings must not shadow a live session. With no live
session, a completed primary, or the newest completed session if no primary
exists, can be selected and pinned. An explicit completed `session_id` always
targets that session. Authorization and validation precede the same resume
admission, which runs before `ProcessOnTurnStart` and message persistence.
FAILED/CANCELLED dispatch continues to reject with its existing error code.

## Follow-up ownership

A message on a completed task is conversation work. Runtime running, waiting,
failed, and finished events do not reopen that task or replay workflow entry,
turn-start, turn-complete, completion-signal, or parent notification effects.
Existing explicit task moves/state APIs remain the way to reopen workflow work.

For an explicitly resumed completed session on a still-active task, persist a
session metadata marker `completion_follow_up` in the guarded resume claim.
It records conversational-only ownership independently of the mutable session
state. Such a session stays excluded from automatic profile reuse and cannot
become primary merely because it resumes. Automatic workflow triggers and
runtime task-state reconciliation skip it. An explicit workflow handoff may
clear the marker only while establishing that session's workflow ownership.
An ordinary send, page activation, or automatic reuse lookup cannot clear it.

Pinned user and MCP sends, queued dispatch, streaming completion, agent exit,
and failure publication consume the same ownership predicate. This protects a
retired profile conversation even after its state becomes `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`.
Preserve primary IDs, profile routing, step history, and current queue policy.

## Cleanup and races

For successful task completion, stop collapsing an ordinary child conversation
to `COMPLETED` in `setSessionWaitingForInputIfRequestedWithHook`. Settle it with
the existing root-task waiting behavior. Keep task status completed and retain
the fail-closed idle resource reclamation. Do not change failed/cancelled task
receipt rules through this branch.

Use current-turn clarification lookup; any active clarification retains its
existing barrier and late-answer path. Historical answered or expired bundles
remain history. A lookup error cannot justify closing the conversation.

Cleanup and resumed execution must use the same lifecycle ownership boundary.
An old receipt, stop callback, stream frame, or reclaim operation carries its
execution identity; after a newer resume claim it cannot clear queues or stop
the replacement runtime. Preserve retired-execution tombstones. Release guards
before waiting for callbacks that need those guards.

Queue admission and readiness use the existing queue-incarnation and dispatch
reservation contract. Never clear pending messages solely because the old
execution completed. Duplicate Resume joins or returns the existing attempt.
A later stop/archive/delete wins over stale recovery writes. A failed launch
uses existing recoverable error state without changing completed task state;
retain the follow-up marker for retry and preserve queued/unsent content.

## User interface

`SessionStoppedBanner` completed mode has primary Resume and secondary New
Agent. Reuse `useSessionRecoveryActions` and existing recovery error feedback.
Show busy state, disable duplicate actions, and restore the composer from the
authoritative session update. Missing profile feedback stays visible. New
Agent retains its dialog and intentional new-conversation behavior.

Keep the completed-chat open-time gate in session-resumption hooks. Extend
recovery hook tests for response success/failure, session switching while a
request is pending, and busy cleanup. Do not let a late response modify another
chat's recovery feedback or selected session.

Show the completion checkbox only in the final step's entry/general settings,
outside the conditional turn-complete controls. It remains available when the
final step has no actions. Put the description inside an adjacent info icon
using the existing HelpTip interaction: hover or focus on desktop, tap on touch.
Do not render the description permanently below the checkbox. Suggested text:
"Marks the task complete when it enters this final step. You can still continue
the conversation." Give the icon a localized accessible name. Use coordinated
dirty/save/discard state and read-only sync treatment. Localize all copy.

### Mobile composition

The existing `task-layout.tsx` phone layout and inline stopped-session banner
are the chat exemplar. Keep the transcript's single scroll owner and the
composer area's safe-area spacing. Stack Resume then New Agent on phones;
retain compact side-by-side buttons on fine-pointer desktop. Phone/coarse
pointer actions have at least 44 px active height; no unconditional desktop
`min-h-11` sizing is introduced.

The step editor's `CancelCompletionToggle` supplies the checkbox/label pattern;
the existing mobile workflow step selector supplies focused navigation. Use a
44 px tappable label and a touch-accessible info icon. Disclose wrapping helper
text through the existing touch help surface; do not require hover or add a
new standalone modal. Opening help must not toggle the checkbox.
An inline setting fits this short choice. Both viewports share draft and save
logic. Preserve keyboard focus, one settings scroll region, no horizontal page
overflow, and access to Save changes above safe-area insets.

## Workspace admission

Task completion, conversation availability, and workspace access have separate
admission rules. `launchRestoreWorkspace` is a workspace operation. It does not
receive `AllowCompletedSessionResume`, transition the session to STARTING, or
call agent configuration/start. Explicit Resume retains the preceding design.

The lifecycle manager's `createExecution` builds workspace infrastructure only.
Replace its calls to `ensureLaunchSessionStillActive` with a workspace-specific
admission check. Keep the active-session check on agent launch and promotion.
Do not remove COMPLETED from global terminal-state helpers or introduce a
client-controlled bypass flag.

Workspace admission resolves the session's canonical `TaskEnvironment` and
checks the current task, session binding, environment identity, owner generation,
archive state, and cleanup admission. COMPLETED, FAILED, or CANCELLED alone is
not proof that the task has relinquished its workspace. Missing records,
database errors, invalid ownership, or an admitted cleanup fail closed.
Reuse the existing task cleanup barrier and generation-aware repository helpers;
do not replace them with a process-local mutex or a path-exists check.

Keep authorization before cache reuse as well as before creation. Retain
`session.exec` and environment access checks for execution-capable surfaces;
viewing conversation history does not grant shell or workspace access.
The environment's actual owner controls destructive cleanup. A borrowing
session cannot authorize changes to another owner's resources.

Use the same admission rule for `EnsureWorkspaceExecutionForSession`,
`GetOrEnsureExecution`, and `GetOrEnsureExecutionForEnvironment`. The session
route remains a lookup handle; it must resolve to the same canonical environment.
An existing environment execution can be reused without replacing its session
binding, running agent, or workflow owner.

For workspace creation, capture admission identity before external operations,
revalidate after runtime creation, persist registration through the existing
cleanup-aware writer, then revalidate before readiness publication. If cleanup,
deletion, ownership transfer, or a newer execution invalidates the claim, roll
back only the runtime created by that attempt. Never tear down a winning sibling
or resumed execution. A completed session present at admission differs from a
concurrent stop or cancellation of the attempt; preserve the existing lifecycle
and cancellation guards rather than inferring cancellation from state alone.

Repository validation uses canonical inventory. Every repository required by
the environment's existing validation contract must pass; one healthy repository
does not excuse another missing or unsafe required repository. Keep the current
handling of historical deleted repository rows. Restoration attaches retained
workspaces and starts access infrastructure; it does not invoke branch replacement
or silently rematerialize an absent checkout. Audit
`reconcileExecutionWorkspace` and `reconcileWorkspaceWorktrees` accordingly.
Explicit unarchive or branch recovery keeps its separate authority.

## Workspace runtime continuity

Retain the common session-keyed singleflight and duplicate-registration rollback
used by session and environment entry points. Coordinate restoration with the
existing explicit-resume lifecycle guard. If Resume wins, workspace consumers
use its execution; if restoration wins, Resume may use the established promotion
or replacement path. Only Resume can start the agent. Do not add another lock
order or an environment-only singleflight bucket that races session requests.

`publishCreatedExecution` emits agentctl Starting before Ready/Error. Preserve
that ordering and workspace stream attachment. These events update workspace
readiness, not task completion, session state, turns, or queue dispatch.
Failure before registration must still reach the initiating request's workspace
error state; waiting for an agentctl error event cannot cover that failure.

Workspace registration can replace a stopped `executors_running` row. Preserve
recoverable provider identity and metadata before doing so. Do not store a
workspace runtime's empty provider fields over the completed conversation's
resume data. Prove restore, restart, then explicit Resume uses the same provider
conversation. Existing session metadata and persistence helpers remain the
source; no schema migration or new durable execution-purpose field is planned.

Startup may release terminal-session runtime resources under existing cleanup
policy. The next authorized workspace access must be able to restore them
without reviving the agent. Old stop, reclaim, and readiness callbacks must not
alter a newer execution. Retain idle resource reclamation; the fix does not keep
every completed task's runtime permanently alive.

## Workspace failure feedback

Carry the known operation (`restore_workspace`) through the frontend request
boundary. Do not infer it by parsing the English error message. Workspace
attempt state is shared by consumers of the same environment and includes
task/environment identity, an attempt revision, pending/ready/error status, a
safe cause, bounded diagnostic detail, and retry eligibility. Reuse environment
state and request guards; do not persist this transient feedback as an agent
launch failure or create independent retry loops in each panel.

Keep this state in the existing `session-runtime` slice beside environment-keyed
Git and shell state. Add pure attempt-state helpers and actions, with defaults,
environment mapping, and purge behavior covered by tests. The domain hook owns
request coordination. Do not treat a session ID as proof of environment identity
when its canonical mapping is unavailable, or let purging a historical session
clear a newer attempt owned by another session in the shared environment.

`useSessionResumption` and `use-session-resumption-operations` publish restore
results to that workspace state. `task-page-inner.tsx` excludes workspace-only
failures from `EnsureSessionErrorBanner` and `SessionRecoveryFeedback` above the
layout. Genuine session ensure/start/resume failures retain their existing
presentation and precedence. Do not hide errors globally for completed tasks.

Extend `WorkspaceUnavailable` for a restoration cause and Retry, rather than
using its setup-failure wording for all cases. Render the shared feedback at
workspace content boundaries, including Files, Changes, and workspace terminals.
On a failed initial load, replace the preparation indicator. If cached content
exists, keep it visible with an inline stale/unavailable notice; do not present
stale data as a successful live refresh. The chat's completed banner, Resume,
and New Agent remain independent. Failure in agent Resume remains chat-owned.

Use a neutral icon, compact title, one short cause, and inline Retry/Details.
Suggested localized copy is "Workspace unavailable" and "Couldn't reconnect
to this task's workspace." Details are collapsed by default and must already
be sanitized and bounded before rendering. A disclosure is not permission to
expose credentials, raw command output, or private paths. Classify workspace
restoration failures correctly in backend logs instead of labelling every
terminal-state rejection as shutdown. Use existing structured diagnostics with
task/session/environment identity and outcome; no new metrics are required.

Retry repeats only workspace restoration and clears matching feedback only
after success. Pending disables duplicate actions. Permission/archive/deleted
or invalid-inventory failures do not retry on a timer. Preserve existing explicit
recovery options where applicable. Task switches and newer attempts invalidate
late results. Readiness reconciliation after reconnect must not overwrite a
newer error with an old ready event.

### Workspace mobile composition

The curated exemplar is `task-layout.tsx` and its dedicated
`mobile/session-mobile-layout.tsx`: phone navigation selects one workspace
panel. The Files panel opens `mobile-file-viewer-panel.tsx` for file content.
Place the error inline in that selected panel. This is a persistent content
failure with a short action, so it needs neither a global banner nor a new drawer.

Desktop keeps compact actions within its workspace pane. Phone/coarse-pointer
Retry and Details have at least 44 px hit areas; apply those dimensions only
to the appropriate responsive variants. Details wrap in the panel's single
vertical scroll region. Preserve the mobile layout's dynamic viewport and
safe-area navigation, keyboard focus, file-viewer back action, and saved desktop
layout. Shared state and retry behavior remain identical across viewports.

## Verification and observability

Use barrier-based Go tests for resume/stop, reclaim/resume, stale receipt/new
execution, double Resume, and readiness/queue admission. Assert the preserved
task, primary session, provider token, history, queue order, and emitted events.
Test both database dialects at migration boundaries. Use existing structured
logs with task/session/execution identity and resume outcome; do not log tokens.

Desktop and mobile Playwright tests save/reload the final-step checkbox, complete
checked final steps, send from unchecked final steps, and Resume a persisted
completed chat. Reorder tests prove the control moves to the current final
step and a previously checked non-final step cannot complete work. Help tests
prove hover/focus/tap disclosure and that opening help does not toggle the value.
Assert a second agent response, unchanged session count and history, and no
task reopen or duplicate completion. Include a retired non-primary session and
active clarification regression. Run against freshly built production assets.

For workspace restoration, use a real retained checkout and a completed session
with no live execution. Prove passive Files/Git/terminal access, unchanged
conversation state, and later explicit Resume on desktop and phone. Test all
three terminal states, shared environments, cache reuse, missing mixed repository
inventory, permissions, cleanup races, and provider identity preservation at the
appropriate unit/integration boundary. Inject one bounded restore failure for
the UI recovery test; do not mock successful workspace restoration in the happy
path. Exact regression names and commands belong to the linked fix package.
